""Who is the dead woman?"" ""Well, if you really must know, she is an old nurse of my wife\'s, Rose Spender by name, whom we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary. We brought her round here, called in Dr. Horsom, of 13, Firbank Villas--mind you take the address, Mr. Holmes--and had her carefully tended, as Christian folk should. On the third day she died--certificate says senile decay--but that\'s only the doctor\'s opinion, and of course you know better. We ordered her funeral to be carried out by Stimson and Co., of the Kennington Road, who will bury her at eight o\'clock to-morrow morning. Can you pick any hole in that, Mr. Holmes? You\'ve made a silly blunder, and you may as well own up to it. I\'d give something for a photograph of your gaping, staring face when you pulled aside that lid expecting to see the Lady Frances Carfax and only found a poor old woman of ninety', '. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall. But you don\'t think so, gentlemen? Surely you don\'t think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!"" He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy. ""You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,"" said Holmes, kindly, putting his hand upon his shoulder. ""Take my advice, and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist them in every way. We shall wait here until your return."" The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark. Chapter VI Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration ""Now, Watson,"" said Holmes, rubbing his hands, ""we have half an hour to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying it', '. Just a common, ordinary burglary, and well within the capacity of the poor old police. No experts need apply."" ""I am sure the case is in very good hands,"" said Holmes. ""Merely a common burglary, you say?"" ""Quite so. We know pretty well who the men are and where to find them. It is that gang of Barney Stockdale, with the big nigger in it--they\'ve been seen about here."" ""Excellent! What did they get?"" ""Well, they don\'t seem to have got much. Mrs. Maberley was chloroformed and the house was---- Ah! here is the lady herself."" Our friend of yesterday, looking very pale and ill, had entered the room, leaning upon a little maid-servant. ""You gave me good advice, Mr. Holmes,"" said she, smiling ruefully. ""Alas, I did not take it! I did not wish to trouble Mr. Sutro, and so I was unprotected."" ""I only heard of it this morning,"" the lawyer explained. ""Mr. Holmes advised me to have some friend in the house. I neglected his advice, and I have paid for it.""

""There are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped. There is no safety for your husband in England."" Two months had gone by, and the case had to some extent passed from our minds. Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our letter box. ""Dear me, Mr. Holmes. Dear me!"" said this singular epistle. There was neither superscription nor signature. I laughed at the quaint message; but Holmes showed unwonted seriousness. ""Deviltry, Watson!"" he remarked, and sat long with a clouded brow. Late last night Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, brought up a message that a gentleman wished to see Mr. Holmes, and that the matter was of the utmost importance. Close at the heels of his messenger came Cecil Barker, our friend of the moated Manor House. His face was drawn and haggard. ""I\'ve had bad news--terrible news, Mr. Holmes,"" said he. ""I feared as much,"" said Holmes. ""You have not had a cable, have you?"" ""I have had a note from someone who has', '. ""What can it mean?"" I gasped. ""It means that it is all over,"" Holmes answered. ""And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott\'s room."" With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand. It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling', '."" ""Who let you out?"" ""Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out. I shut the hall door behind me. The window of the room in which they sat was closed, but the blind was not drawn down.

Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the chair.

""I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way account for them?"" ""It\'s devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!"" cried Mortimer Tregennis. ""It is not of this world. Something has come into that room which has dashed the light of reason from their minds. What human contrivance could do that?""
