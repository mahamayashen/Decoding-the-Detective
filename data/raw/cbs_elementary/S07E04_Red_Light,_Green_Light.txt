HOLMES: Previously on Elementary BELL (on phone): The captain, he's been shot.
I came straight from the airport.
So that's Captain Dwyer.
BELL: He's gonna cover both squads, until we know more about Captain Gregson.
(crying): My name is Carmen Zelaya.
That video was given to her brother, Halcon Zelaya, the man who runs Mara Tres.
What do you want?
I know who k*lled your sister.
You can call me Patrick.
It's not Lieutenant Meers, anymore.
I left the army last year.
I did it.
I didn't really want to sh**t that cop, the captain I didn't want to, but he figured it out.
He never wavered from his story, and there's no way to prove that he knew about Tim Bledsoe's plan to blow up the ferry.
HOLMES: Patrick Meers was not acting alone.
Someone or some group were pulling his strings.
Is the captain doing any better?
Still hasn't regained consciousness.
The docs think there may be something in there still bleeding.
(birds chirping)
DWYER: He was a hell of a guy.
I-I know you were close, you and Tommy.
You didn't just lose your captain, you lost your friend.
But I want you to know that as long as I'm the boss at the 11th, you and your partner will always have a home to go Stop.
Stop what?
Talking.
You're annoying me.
I'm trying to do right by you here.
No.
You're not real.
None of this is real.
I've had this dream before.
Usually, it's Watson who approaches me, sometimes it's Marcus.
One time, it was a scary clown with an axe.
It's your first appearance.
Presumably, because you and I met in reality for the first time just a few hours ago.
I'm disappointed, really.
I mean, not in you, but in myself, in my subconscious.
(chuckles)
You'd think it could find new ways to express my concern for my friend.
You think this is a dream?
Yeah, I'm asleep at home.
And the captain's still in hospital.
And what about the scary clown with the axe?
He go back to the m*rder-circus?
Know what?
I take it back.
You and your partner aren't welcome at the 11th.
You're nuts.
(machine whirring)
(sighs)
(elevator bell dings)
You got here fast.
You said he wanted to see me?
Paige said that he asked for both us when he woke up.
- She's here?
- Downstairs.
She hadn't eaten, so I said I'd sit with him until she got back.
So he already said everything he wanted to say to me.
It's your turn.
(knocking on door)
Hey.
Good to see you.
Joan said you squared everything with the Feds.
No one's gonna take you out of here in cuffs.
My days as a fugitive are over.
Paige told me you came to see me.
I don't know what you said, but, uh, I appreciate you not pulling the plug.
(chuckles)
Well, it was, it was good to see you.
It's, uh put everything in perspective.
I've got perspective to spare today.
I wanted you to know that before all this happened, I was gonna call you.
It's over.
The unfortunate business between us, that's in the past now.
A day like today?
I'd prefer to look forward.
I'd like that, too.
Â  (singing along with stereo): This song is not for you If you never cried a river Or had your heart broke in two I can walk by myself.
No.
You can't.
(laughs)
Oh, stop.
The skies are blue But this is for anyone (humming)
Yeah.
I look good still going on.
I look good.
Not too bad.
But you try - And you try.
- (brakes squealing)
What the?
What was that?
Hold her, please.
And call 911.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.
I'm good.
Hey, I'm a nurse.
Um, your friend needs medical attention.
Can you help me?
I need help opening this door.
Hey!
I said I need hel (expl*si*n)
Elementary 7x04 Red Light, Green Light Â  (indistinct chatter)
(indistinct conversation)
b*mb squad says it looks like the van was a VBIED, or a "Vehicle Borne Improvised expl*sive Device.
" They're still checking the wreckage, but they think the expl*sive was gasoline, a few hundred gallons hidden in the back.
You said that two people were k*lled, huh?
The driver of the van and a woman who was trying to help.
According to one of her friends, the truck had the green light, the van blew through the intersection and T-boned the tractor trailer.
The van's driver was stuck behind the wheel, but his passenger was able to get out.
He ran, and then boom.
So, either the b*mb went off accidentally, or the passenger triggered it as he ran.
No way of knowing what their final destination was, but this is New York.
It's not like we're short on places to blow up.
I would've reached out to you and Sherlock either way, but after everything we went through with Patrick Meers What, you think this is connected?
You were the ones who thought him and Tim Bledsoe might be part of some terror cell.
Well, Bledsoe used fertilizer in his device, not gasoline.
But it was still a car b*mb.
Meanwhile, the friend of the woman who died said the passenger had dark hair and a dark complexion.
That got the Feds thinking Al-Qaeda or !sis.
If it's one of those groups, they like to carry out multiple att*cks.
That could mean there are more car bombs out there.
You said Sherlock was here already?
Is that the driver?
Yeah.
What's left of him.
Despite the description you were given, I can virtually guarantee you this man is not a member of Al-Qaeda or !sis.
I'm listening.
Look at the belt buckle.
Despite the charring, you can quite clearly see it's a white cross on a field of blue.
What kind of Islamic extremist wears a cross on his way to blowing himself up for the cause?
HOLMES: Furthermore, while it might be from the 19th-century flag of Greece, it is more likely the insignia of La Libertad, a departamento of El Salvador.
You said the witness you spoke to described seeing dark smudges on the face of the man who ran.
Yeah.
She thought it was grease or something, from the crash.
Yeah, what if it wasn't grease?
What if it was tattoos?
El Salvador, facial tattoos, so you think this guy and his friend were members of Mara Tres.
HOLMES: While it is possible two members of a vicious street g*ng were co-opted by t*rrorists, it's more likely the b*mb they were carrying was intended for a rival group.
That makes sense.
I mean, the last time we dealt with Mara Tres, they massacred a bunch of SBK members.
They like to go big.
I'll talk to Captain Dwyer and the Feds.
Tell them it's something we need to consider.
So I know the FBI doesn't want to arrest us anymore, but if you're done here, I'd rather not linger.
The evidence has spoken, Watson, and it said "Mara Tres.
" The authorities can come at this any way they want.
You and I have got a man on the inside.
We do?
Halcon Zelaya?
That's your man inside.
I realize you're not a fan.
"Not a fan"?
The guy is responsible for dozens of murders, not to mention the fact that the last time we saw him he was carting his dead sister around in a crate.
Well, he was grieving.
And, to be fair, he didn't put her in the crate, her k*ller did.
Okay.
Let's say you're right.
Mara Tres is responsible for the b*mb.
Halcon is their New York boss.
Why would he tell you anything?
Let's say two of his men really did become radicalized.
He may be a criminal, but he lives by a code.
I think he would help us identify them.
You said it's more likely the b*mb was meant for a rival g*ng.
That would mean he was the one behind the b*mb.
If he was, and he lies to me, I'll know it.
Then at least we'll know we're on the right track.
Anyway, he still hasn't responded to any of my messages.
(phone chimes)
He hasn't got your number, has he?
It's the captain.
He says he's been catching up on everything that happened after Patrick Meers shot him.
He wants to talk to us.
Go.
I'll continue my search for Halcon without you.
Are you sure?
If I wind up in a crate, you'll know I should've left well enough alone.
GREGSON: Ugh.
Thanks for coming.
Of course.
Sherlock would've come, too, but there was an expl*si*n in Harlem last night.
Yeah.
I heard.
I should've figured you two'd be helping out.
It's okay.
It's covered.
Think it had anything to do with this guy?
It crossed our minds, but no.
It doesn't look related.
Is that why you wanted to see us?
(sighs)
No.
Not exactly.
I had to twist Marcus's arm to get this, but I wanted to find out how everything went down after I got shot.
The stuff that you figured out about Tim Bledsoe?
The b*mb he was building?
That was news to me.
I was looking at Meers for the same reason Marcus did.
I thought he k*lled Bledsoe after they got in a fight outside a bar.
Well, Meers told me that you went to see him at his office.
There was a photograph of a snack bar that his partner helped build.
You thought that might be where Bledsoe's body was hidden, so you went there, Meers followed, then he shot you.
He told you this all happened on the same night, only it didn't.
What do you mean?
I went to see Meers the day before.
And that photo?
If it was on his wall, I never saw it.
I found it online the next day.
I was doing a search of Meers' name, and it's one of the images that came up.
It was part of his construction company's website.
That's when I went to the baseball field.
So, more than 24 hours passed between you talking to Meers, and him sh**ting you?
Why would he lie about that?
HALCON: You brought it, my dogs.
Those punks tried to take what's yours, but you didn't back down.
You went right at them.
You punished them for their arrogance.
'Cause that's how we do, right?
All right, on three, give me a "bulldogs.
" One, two, three.
ALL: Bulldogs!
All right, Tristan's mom has orange slices in her car.
Make sure you put the trash in the cans.
I don't want to find no rinds on the ground.
Hey, you did a great job today, buddy.
All right, I'm a little proud of you, all right, mijo?
All right, now go get some oranges.
Go, go, go, go, go!
(indistinct shouting)
You play five up front, three in the middle and two at the back.
That formation went out with the plague.
Well, kids this age-- the more players you got kicking the ball at the opposing goal, the better.
But I'm betting you're not here to talk about soccer.
When I couldn't contact you via traditional means, I reached out to a street informant.
Imagine my surprise when they told me you disappeared two years ago, and that Mara Tres has been under new leadership ever since.
He said there was a rumor that you managed to buy your way out.
Tell me, Halcon-- did you pay in money or blood?
Halcon's dead, Holmes.
I'm just Danny now.
I'm a civilian.
After my sister got k*lled, you know, I just couldn't take it no more, you know?
The life.
So, did what I had to.
I got the right blessings, disappeared, I married my girl.
I moved her and my son up here to Connecticut.
It's nice, right?
I don't know who removed your tattoos, but I'm very impressed.
Yeah.
Wasn't cheap.
So how'd you find me?
I paid a visit to your sister's grave.
It was very well-maintained, as I expected, and decorated with fresh flowers.
I went to local florists, managed to procure the credit card information of your new identity, "Danny Hurtado.
" Always thought you were smart.
But a smart man would have let a sleeping dog like me lie.
So why you here?
You heard about the expl*si*n in New York?
We think that your former g*ng may be responsible.
(laughs)
What?
They said on the news they think it's t*rrorists.
Hmm.
My boys are life-takers, sure, but t*rrorists?
Come on.
There's no money in it.
It's possible the two men involved were freelancing.
Anyway, I need their names.
Holmes, I told you.
I'm done with Mara Tres.
You left on good terms, so there must be someone you can call.
If you'd prefer, I could call the local authorities and have a conversation with them about Coach Hurtado's colorful past.
It's up to you.
All right.
Bad news is, I was only able to get you one name.
But the good news is, I was right.
That van blowing up had nothing to do with a t*rror1st attack.
It wasn't a b*mb.
That was a fuel-skimmer.
And the driver-- the one who was k*lled-- his name was Bosco Jimenez.
The van was tricked out, had all these big bags, these bladders, and he and his partner would go from gas station to gas station using stolen credit card numbers and fill up those bladders.
Once they reached 400 or 500 gallons' worth, then they would go to the other stations and sell it at a discount.
That didn't happen last night, did it?
No, 'cause that idiot truck driver ran a red, Bosco T-boned him.
Who told you the driver ran a red?
The guy I just called.
He said that the guy who was with Bosco said it.
Well, the guy who was with Bosco was lying, because the truck had a green light.
Witness to the crash confirmed it.
No, no, there's no way.
I knew Bosco, okay?
The guy was a legend.
He was the best wheelman ever.
He drove that van and ran dr*gs up from Mexico, ran point on dozens of drive-bys, all without ever getting busted.
No tickets, no accidents, no nothing.
There's no way he would've driven a van full of gasoline through a red light.
Nah, it had to be the other guy.
Not necessarily.
You calling me a liar?
I'm saying there's a possibility that everyone involved is telling the truth.
Neither Bosco nor the truck driver ran a red light, because they both had greens.
You think the light was broken?
That's one possibility.
Another possibility is that it was h*jacked.
(phone ringing, indistinct chatter)
Am I crazy, or do we have a bunch of Feds in our conference room?
I see FBI, DEA, ICE.
Yeah, it's the Interdepartmental Task Force assigned to Mara Tres.
Sherlock and Joan asked me to invite them over to talk about the van that blew up.
Do I go in?
You could, but pretty sure they won't be in there very long.
So, in other words, the accident wasn't an accident?
Someone hacked the traffic light there and made the van hit the truck?
In addition to confirming that both of the lights were indeed green, we've also confirmed everything my informant told us.
The driver of the van was, indeed, Bosco Jimenez, wheelman extraordinaire.
WATSON: Now he and his partner were using the van to skim fuel, but they never meant for it to blow up.
But the person who messed with the traffic lights did?
MAN: I don't buy it.
Mara Tres is a street g*ng.
None of their enemies are sophisticated enough to take over a traffic grid.
Well, I can think of one.
You.
WATSON: Say we never found out about the fuel-skimming.
Most people would've assumed that Mara Tres was getting into the car-bombing business.
And that likely would've been all that you needed to have them declared a t*rror1st organization.
That would have meant more money in your budget, better equipment.
HOLMES: And permission to use any number of draconian anti-terror measures against them.
Their demise would have been all but assured.
What the hell are you saying?
He's saying he thinks that the real t*rrorists are us.
Before I start fielding calls from the bosses of every agent you just insulted in there, I want to know, what the hell were you thinking?
We were thinking that, given our new understanding of the facts, we were addressing the pool of suspects most likely to have caused the crash.
We wanted to see how they reacted.
HOLMES: Having done that, we no longer think any of them was involved.
I mean, which is still progress, because now that we've ruled out the Task Force, we can move on to other suspects.
I thought they were your only suspects.
In fact, our theory would hold for other, more powerful members of the U. S. government.
The Task Force's superiors at Justice, perhaps, or the attorney general.
(laughs)
Attorney general?
We should get Bell to invite him down here, too.
Oh, I didn't know they knew each other.
Look, I don't know what kind of arrangement you had with Tommy.
It was simple-- catch criminals, even at the expense of their feelings.
(knock at door)
Come in.
A bit of good news-bad news out there.
Tried to smooth everything over, but it seems the Feds are pretty touchy these days about having their honor questioned.
Most of 'em stormed off.
And the good news?
The one person who stayed is an FBI agent named Dia Tanyag.
She says Sherlock and Joan might be onto something.
TANYAG: First, far as I know, none of us arranged that crash.
The only guys I could even imagine going that far would be the two cowboys we have from ICE, but I'm telling you, they're too dumb to pull it off.
Even if that weren't the case, we don't need to k*ll anyone to get a leg up on Mara Tres.
We've already got one.
What do you mean?
Over the last couple years, we've managed to take a lot of Mara Tres's pieces off the board.
Most of their leadership has been arrested, deported, forced to flee or pushed underground.
So you're saying the house of Mara Tres is crumbling, along with our theory.
Not all of it.
I think you guys could be right about someone rigging those traffic lights.
A few months back, someone planted a Trojan horse virus in the city's traffic control system.
They used that code to override dozens of traffic lights so a group of bank robbers could make a clean getaway.
I can put you in touch with the agent in charge, but last I heard, they still haven't found them, or the hacker who engineered the virus.
All we got was his handle: "Overlord.
" You guys want to find the group that caused that crash, I'd start with him.
(footsteps approaching)
What's with all the gelatin?
It's a gift from our hack-happy helpers at Everyone.
Oh, that was nice of them.
It's the opposite, in fact.
In exchange for searching for Overlord's true identity, I've been order to put every ounce of this powder into my isolation chamber.
They've asked for video evidence within the hour.
That's actually pretty funny.
Let's see how funny you find it when you need to use the bathroom later on, 'cause my chamber is not the only t*nk of water I've been ordered to gelatinize.
Marcus, meanwhile, is reaching out to the Department of Transportation to learn more about the virus which infected their system.
How goes your reinvestigation into Patrick Meers?
I think I figured out why Meers lied about when the captain came to see him.
He was protecting an accomplice.
The day he confessed, he told me and Marcus that he followed the captain from his office to the baseball field.
Well, that would be a lie.
He would have followed him from the precinct to the baseball field.
You would think.
But according to CCS, several apps on Meers' phone featured real-time location tracking.
All of them placed him at his house until ten minutes before the captain was shot.
You think someone else had eyes on the captain that night.
That person followed him to the baseball field and then called Meers to the scene.
Well, that would support the idea that there is a conspiracy afoot.
Is there any evidence of Meers receiving a call or a text?
No, but that doesn't mean much.
He and his partner could have used burners.
Well, the last time you visited Meers, the captain's prognosis was grim.
Now he's on the mend.
Well, Meers won't be charged as a cop k*ller, and he might even get a shot at a deal if he flips on the people he's working with.
Well, I have an isolation chamber to desecrate.
But if I were you, I'd think about paying him a visit.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr.
Halevi.
Actually, it's Maranek-Halevi.
My wife and I hyphenated.
Her idea.
No judgment here.
(chuckles)
Then I already like you better than my brother.
So, this is it?
Everything the Department of Transportation has on Overlord's traffic grid virus?
All 920 pages.
Plus schematics on every model of traffic light the robbers compromised on their way to a New York City land speed record.
You do know I already gave copies of this stuff to the FBI five months ago?
Sorry, making you do this twice, but the Bureau only had the case for a minute.
Agent who caught it told me the NSA came in and took over, since they have "technical jurisdiction" on hacking cases.
Let me guess.
The NSA's not too big on sharing.
To put it mildly.
Well, I'm happy to help.
This Overlord guy pulled our pants down at DOT.
I'm not saying he's my white whale or anything, but if helping you means he'd hit even one red light, I'll take it-- especially if he's the one who caused that accident the other night.
You say "if.
" Does that mean you haven't found Overlord's virus in your system this time?
We didn't find it the first time.
His Trojan Horse was a nasty piece of code.
Not only did it wreak havoc in our grid, it deleted itself when it was done.
So you don't think there's anything in the data that'll help us put a name or face to this guy?
It took weeks to find even a trace of his code.
And it wasn't what you'd call useful.
It was just Overlord's hacker handle and a GIF of a raised middle finger.
(chuckles)
Sorry, I wish I had more.
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)
It's Jane, right?
No, Joan.
I know we only met that one time, but I've always been pretty good with names.
I appreciate your taking the time to speak with me.
Time's all I have now, Joan.
Actually, I don't think that's true.
That's the reason I'm here.
The police officer you shot, Captain Gregson, he's gonna live.
Really?
You seem disappointed.
Why would I be disappointed?
I already told you I felt awful about that.
The only person I ever wanted to k*ll was Tim Bledsoe.
Because he sucker-punched you outside a bar?
Right.
The reason I'm here, Mr.
Meers, is because I think there's a little more to it than that.
Tim Bledsoe built a b*mb, and you knew about it.
(chuckles softly)
I already told you.
I didn't know what he was up to.
Me sh**ting him when I did, it was a coincidence.
The captain is conscious and talking now, so we know that you lied about when he came to see you.
What we don't know is why.
Now, my best guess: you're protecting someone.
The captain lived-- that's good for you.
So the D. A.
might be willing to consider a plea deal now.
You tell us the truth about everything you know, and you might not have to spend the rest of your life behind bars.
I wish I could help you, Joan.
I really do.
But I've said all I'm gonna say about it.
What about your wife?
Your children.
Do you even care that they're gonna grow up thinking that their father was a t*rror1st?
A t*rror1st?
You were working with Tim, right, that's how you knew about the b*mb?
- No.
- You were in the same group, or cell.
Something happened, so your plans changed.
So Tim and his b*mb had to go.
- No.
- Someone in the group realized that the captain was gonna find Tim's body, so he, or she, messaged you to get to the baseball field right away.
I told you I'm not a t*rror1st, damn it!
(breath trembling)
I'm done talking.
(doorbell rings)
You're Sherlock Holmes?
You're NSA?
Agent Heller.
And this is Overlord.
But we mostly just call him Phil.
Right.
Before we hand him over, Agent McNally asked me to ask you: How'd you know that we, uh, brought him into the fold?
Suffice it to say the NSA does not have a monopoly on making friends of dangerous hackers.
Mine were set to the task of identifying Overlord.
They failed to do so via his code, but stumbled upon a flame w*r between him and another hacker, Mouse Queen, on a chat board.
Things got personal, and the locations of genital moles were mentioned, and I realized it was a lovers' quarrel.
And while your friends couldn't ID Phil here, they could ID Mouse Queen.
She not only gave me Phil's real name, but she also admitted to being the one who turned him over to your agency.
Wait?
What?
You guys never told me that.
Phil made a deal.
He works with us for the foreseeable future, and doesn't go to prison for any of his hacks.
But here's the thing.
He's heavily monitored, and has been for months.
That means there's no way he's responsible for the crash you're looking into.
I assumed so.
But that doesn't rule out the possibility that his code was used by a friend.
Phil?
It's just that the guys I sent it to, they're my pals.
And before I rat them out, I just need to know that it was my code that caused that crash.
How many traffic light cheat codes can there be?
You'd be surprised.
You told him that the DO gave you and the cops a whole bunch of data from the night it happened, right?
- Yeah.
Let me see it.
I'll know if it was my code that got used, and if it was, then I'll give you all the names you want.
Okay, I need you to pull up traffic cam footage from another light-- you ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Sector D-41.
9:42 p. m.
Serial number TC-311-899.
Okay.
Pulling up footage of that light now.
HOLMES: Why are you looking at every light in the area except the one that caused the crash?
Because according to this data from the DOT, a bunch of lights that night were hacked.
I figured we should check all of them.
Turns out that whoever did this tried more than once to crash that van that night.
Good news is, wasn't any of my friends.
How can you be sure?
Well, when my virus overrode a traffic light, the light would flicker twice.
It was a bug.
But these lights we've been looking at all night, not one of them has flickered.
You said there was more than one attempt to crash the van.
Oh, yeah.
Well, just look at all these lights along Broadway.
They were hacked, too.
They kept turning green, one after another.
It was just a matter of time before that van got in a wreck.
No, it wasn't.
The path you just highlighted was not the path of the van, it was the path of the truck.
Wait.
That would mean that the hacker wasn't gunning for the Mara Tres guys.
He was gunning for the truck driver.
We've been coming at this all wrong.
This is crazy.
You sure I'm the one they were gunning for?
If you look at the map, you could see, you got a whole string of greens from the George Washington Bridge into Harlem.
That let you build up a head of steam.
And then here, 60 seconds before your collision with the van, you and a city bus drew simultaneous greens.
It was the hacker's first attempt to do you harm.
In addition to controlling the lights, we're pretty sure he got into the traffic cameras in the area.
He was watching for you, trying to line you up for a crash.
Footage from that intersection shows the bus slamming on its brakes, but you, on the other hand, didn't seem to notice.
Guess I didn't.
Had my music up loud.
I was singing.
I was in a great mood that night: all those greens, I thought my luck was changing.
What do you mean?
I mean, driving in that part of town has been awful the last few months.
I would never get greens.
Just reds, one after another.
Can you think of anyone who wants to do you harm?
No one.
Think, Jarius.
Look, at the risk of sounding prideful, I'm a nice guy.
God-fearing.
I go to church.
Don't drink, don't gamble.
Any exes?
Romantic rivals?
No one.
Any insurance policies out on you?
No.
Did you see anything you shouldn't have, either at work or in your neighborhood?
Our neighborhood's great.
So are the people I work for.
I thank God for them every day.
And if I had seen something illegal somewhere, I would've gone to the police.
Look, I'm telling you, there's no one who wants me dead.
Well, in that case, what were you hauling that night?
I don't know exactly.
Why?
'Cause if you weren't the target, then we have to assume your truck was.
Everything was in big crates.
No one told me what was in them.
But I was headed to this construction site on West 57th.
I figured it was stuff they needed to build their building, a big skyscraper.
I've been making drop-offs to them for months.
But why would someone want to blow up a bunch of building supplies?
Well, that's a good question.
And it depends what was in those crates.
Elevators.
That's what that truck was delivering.
Elevators?
The best that money can buy.
Imagine flying up a hundred floors in less than 40 seconds.
My client wants his tower mentioned in the same breath as One World Trade.
Figured four of the fastest elevators in the world would do it.
Each one clocked in at a cool $3 million.
If you're right, if that crash the other night was deliberate that would mean someone's trying to sabotage me.
Well, say they were, Mr.
Dewashe.
Construction budgets have cushions built in to absorb overruns, right?
And those elevators had to be insured.
So if someone was looking to hurt you, was this really the best way to do it?
In the short term, no.
No, you're right, the insurance will pay for the new elevators.
But it'll take time.
This job will be delayed, but the next one may not even happen.
What do you mean?
A few months ago, I won a bid to put up this building.
It's part of Hudson Yards.
Worth billions.
But the bid is contingent upon me wrapping up my current job on time.
You happen to know who the next highest bidder was?
A company called Maranek Construction.
Maranek?
You heard of 'em?
The company, no, but I know the name.
HOLMES: Marcus.
Hey.
I just wrapped up with the head of the construction company.
He's positive his truck was targeted.
He thinks it was a competitor of his, Maranek Construction.
Thing is, I met a Maranek just the other day.
The guy from the DOT.
The one who brought me everything they had on the Overlord hack.
His name was Saul Maranek-Halevi.
I did a search.
Turns out he's the son-in-law of the guy who owns Maranek Construction.
He's the one who caused that crash.
Got to be.
There was no virus in the DOT's system.
He probably did what he did from his desk.
Hey, you there?
I am, and I think you're right about everything.
Good.
I'll pick you up, and we'll pay him a visit.
Actually, I'm with him right now.
You are?
Something came over my scanner that I thought I should look into.
Suspected Mara Tres activity.
Two heavily tattooed sh**t gunned down a man outside his home.
Don't tell me.
Yeah.
Saul Maranek-Halevi is dead.
Everything that has happened in the last few weeks, there's just-- there's no explaining it.
But if there is one thing that I can tell you for sure, one thing that I know in my heart, it's that Patrick is no t*rror1st.
Then how can you explain him sh**ting Tim Bledsoe one day before he was gonna blow up the ferry?
Patrick said that was a coincidence.
I believe him.
Okay, you want to know why he joined the army?
His father was a fireman.
He was in the South Tower the day that it fell.
Patrick was just in high school.
What he went through that day, he would never put someone else through that.
Never.
Patrick got back from Afghanistan a few months before he shot Tim.
Was it hard for him, adjusting?
Well, yeah, sure.
But it's hard for a lot of people.
Was he spending time with any new friends?
As in "friends that would blow up a ferry"?
No.
Truth is, he mostly kept to himself.
If he wasn't at work or with the kids, he was just in there, playing his game.
His game?
It was some sh**ting thing.
I didn't like it, but he was hooked.
He'd play it for hours.
Do you mind if I take a look?
(growling sounds)
HOLLY: Why did you want to see this?
You said that Patrick wasn't spending time with anyone new.
Games like these usually have a chat function so you can talk to other players.
And since we didn't find anything unusual in Patrick's texts or e-mails HOLLY: So you thought you'd check his video game?
Do you know who R00kR3d is?
No.
Looks like he's online.
(snarling sounds)
(phone ringing)
(sighs)
Hello.
HALCON: Hey.
It's me, hittin' you back.
You were right.
Mara Tres did g*n down your boy.
May I ask why?
One of 'em got a call this morning.
The guy on the other line, he wouldn't say who it was-- just that a Saul Maranek-Halevi is the one who got Bosco k*lled in that crash.
And your former friends just took him at his word, did they?
Oh, no, no.
They checked.
Saw that Maranek-Halevi worked at the DOT, and that was that.
Hey, you wanted him brought to justice, right?
Mara Tres just beat you to it.
Look, I know you've been out of the m*rder game for a while, but do you think your old friends were tipped off by a doe-eyed innocent or by a coconspirator of Maranek-Halevi's looking to use them to tie up a loose end?
Yeah.
I see what you mean.
I got to say, I'm, uh I'm a little embarrassed, yo.
You should be.
If I'm right, the dead man was just a puppet.
The person pulling his strings is gonna get away with everything.
Aw, come on in.
(grunts)
Julie's inside.
It'll mean a lot to her that you're here.
BELL: Cameron Maranek?
I'm Detective Bell.
This is Mr. Holmes.
We're investigating what happened to your son-in-law, Saul.
We were hoping we could discuss the case with you.
Do we have to do this now?
I mean, my daughter's grieving inside.
I got the whole family over here.
Our apologies for the intrusion, but there may be a way that you can help us apprehend the person responsible for Saul's death.
Person responsible?
Was told it was a g*ng k*lling, that it must've been random.
A g*ng did commit the act, yes, but we think someone may have steered them to it.
This is all pretty time-sensitive.
And like we said, we could really use your help.
Maybe there's someplace private we could talk?
MARANEK: So, Saul Jerry-rigged the traffic lights to cause the crash so that the elevators on the truck were destroyed?
And Mr.
Dewashe's company would, in turn, lose the job they had successfully bid on at Hudson Yards.
Thing is, we don't think Saul ever meant to destroy the elevators.
When he gave that van a green light, there's no way he could've known it was being driven by two Mara Tres soldiers or that it was full of gasoline.
- Mm.
It's more likely he just wanted to delay the elevators while the accident was investigated.
Just a day or two would've set Dewashe back considerably.
BELL: When it came out in the news that the driver who died was a member of Mara Tres, the person working with Saul saw an opportunity.
He tipped the g*ng to Saul's identity, and they k*lled him without realizing they were doing his partner a favor.
(sighs)
Saul.
Mm.
Were you not fond of your son-in-law?
No.
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, he was kind to Julie, and that's all that mattered.
But she could've done better.
So, uh, you said there's a way I can help you?
Whoever was behind it all, what they did was pretty smart.
With Saul dead, there was no way for us to ID him.
We thought that was that.
But then Mr.
Holmes here thought of a way we could flush him out.
Yeah, it just so happens I once investigated a matter for the Japanese firm which manufactured the damaged elevators.
As a favor to me, they agreed to call Mr.
Dewashe's company this morning and promise to replace the elevators by tomorrow evening.
Ah.
Lucky for Dewashe.
It would be, if it were true.
Sorry?
The Japanese firm agreed to say all of this, but none of it's true.
It didn't have to be.
It just had to sound true to your mole inside Dewashe's company.
No, no, no.
You hang on just one second.
BELL: There's no point denying it, Mr. Maranek.
We even know who the mole is.
Her name is Sandra Bay, and she's Dewashe's transportation coordinator.
According to the company's phone records, she made a lot of calls to a burner phone the last few months.
Every time she did, Dewashe would suffer a mysterious scheduling snag the same day.
It's almost as if the traffic grid itself were conspiring against them, which, it turns out, it was.
Your son-in-law had been interfering with trucks headed to Dewashe's construction site on 57th Street for months.
Perhaps you coerced him into manipulating the traffic lights via emotional blackmail, promising you would finally accept him as one of the family.
Or perhaps you and he had a financial arrangement.
I suppose there's no way we'll ever really know.
Unless you tell us.
Which you'll have plenty of time to do in custody.
(phone chimes)
I suppose I should tell you how we got to Sandra.
The burner phone I mentioned, it was also used to deliver the anonymous tip to Mara Tres.
An informant inside the g*ng gave Mr.
Holmes the number.
We got a subpoena to check its activity.
And, bam, there they were: all those calls to and from Sandra.
We've had eyes on her ever since.
This says she just got the news about the new elevators and that she's stepping outside to make a call.
(phone ringing)
You gonna answer that?
(phone continues ringing)
(grunts)
WATSON: Look who's up and around.
(chuckles)
Halfway up.
It's progress.
I got to get ready.
They're kicking me out next week.
You look better.
Can I borrow him?
I got your text.
CCS have any luck identifying this R00kR3d person?
No, there's no trace of him on the k*ll Zombies Dead server.
It's like he was never there.
Best guess, someone got into their system and then erased him.
Or maybe an outfit named k*ll Zombies Dead doesn't keep the most meticulous record.
Something's up.
Something strange.
(sighs)
I mean, Meers absolutely knew what Bledsoe was up to.
Yet I believed him when he said he isn't a t*rror1st.
Joan, the guys in !sis don't think they're t*rrorists either.
They think they're the good guys.
We'll have to stay on him.
We'll figure it out.
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)
GUARD: Okay!
Shivering so Come in from the cold What's wrong?
Were the guards jerks again?
No.
No, I think I think I made a mistake.
A detective came to the house.
A woman.
Was her name Joan?
I didn't tell her anything.
I don't-- I don't know anything.
Not really.
But she asked to see your gaming system, and I told her that she could.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I should never have It's all right.
She came to see me, too.
I was expecting something like this.
The video game.
Is that how you talk to them?
Okay, they-they would never hurt the kids, would they?
I need you to be brave now.
Can you be brave?
I've got a bad, bad Feeling I've got a bad, bad Yeah.
I can be brave.
I've got a bad Bad feeling About this.
