WATSON: Previously on Elementary...
You are Halcon Zelaya, leader of your g*ng, Mara Tres.
(Holmes grunts)
Shinwell will not help himself.
He just wants to hurt others.
I've become quite certain that in the end  he'll hurt you as well.
Shinwell.
GREGSON: We're gonna find the guy who did this.
Tomorrow morning we go to w*r  with one of New York's deadliest gangs.
You didn't send me a text yesterday?
No.
I-I didn't recognize the number,  but I thought maybe you switched phones.
You wanted to see me?
I had to lie to a colleague of mine today about this-this text.
That can't happen again.
Then stop ignoring me.
Or what?
Things will get worse.
WATSON: Tyus Wilcox has been running  one of the most dangerous gangs in New York for a decade.
I'm an innocent man.
Until we prove you guilty.
Whiffle ball, b*llet casing, pink barrette,  licorice stick, audio cassette tape,  counterfeit lottery ticket, bulldog clip,  yellow handkerchief, matchbook.
Iron-on patch.
WATSON: Sherlock.
(grunts)
You get my messages?
Yeah.
You and Marcus thought  that you could prove Bonzi Folsom  m*rder*d Carol Logan.
Before you could obtain a DNA sample,  he was poisoned by his brother.
I'm quite up to speed.
I need to ask you a question  and it's very important that you tell me the truth.
Are you using again?
Why would you ask me that?
You seem distracted lately.
The morning after Shinwell was k*lled,  right before we were gonna start to investigate,  you left to go to a meeting.
This afternoon you were gone for hours.
The last few weeks, you've been sleeping a lot more.
Yeah, well, I'm not a machine, Watson.
I must sleep on occasion.
Do you want to see between my toes as well?
Hmm?
Do you want?
This thing that we started with SBK, I cannot do it on my own.
I need your help.
Yeah, well, I'm at your disposal, Watson.
Well, there's nothing else we can do tonight.
Besides, I need to sleep.
I'm not a machine, either.
♪ ♪  Yo, Duane.
It's a party, man.
Loosen up.
It's just weird, is all.
Bonzi in the hospital and everything.
Yo, our boy, Lamar, got out from Rikers today.
No way we wasn't gonna celebrate.
♪ ♪  Got a message from Tall Boy today.
He was careful.
It came through his lawyer.
Levine?
Nah, the other one.
Grimaldi.
Tall Boy gave him a name.
Joan Watson.
Said she works for the police,  but that she isn't police.
He thinks she the one got Shinwell to turn snitch.
Tall Boy say where to find her?
No...
but Grimaldi dug up an address.
SOCKS: If we go pay her a visit right now...
...you gonna cheer up?
(g*nf*re)
(woman screaming)
♪ ♪  GREGSON: This one was an SBK lieutenant, Darion Barber.
His g*ng name was Socks.
A little after 11:00 p.m., three gunmen opened fire  with a*t*matic weapons, k*lling Mr.
Barber,  five of his SBK associates,  two of their girlfriends and two children.
Safe to assume the sh**t  were also g*ng affiliated?
Mara Tres.
At least that's what we have to assume  off their descriptions.
Mara Tres and SBK are longtime rivals.
They've gotten into scraps about territory over the years,  a beatdown here, a drive-by there, but nothing like this.
There's only one way to read it.
Declaration of w*r.
BELL: Got to figure they heard  about Bonzi Folsom overdosing,  thought they'd hit SBK while they're down.
The department's at DEFCON 1.
Obviously, SBK is gonna want to retaliate,  blood for blood.
We've got extra units patrolling both of their territories,  but I think we all know that the next move is in the hands  of just one guy.
Tyus Wilcox.
GREGSON: I want to have a chat with him,  explain that it's in everyone's best interest  to let us take things from here.
With your permission, I'd like to do some talking of my own.
To?
Julio “Halcon” Zelaya, the leader of Mara Tres.
I did some work for him once.
Provided I could find him, I would let him know  that the department already has SBK  firmly in their crosshairs.
What I won't mention is that he and his people will be next.
That is, of course,  if I have my partner's permission  to be away for a while.
Be careful.
May the Lord be in your heart  and help you to confess your sins with great sorrow.
You first, Father Baldomero.
Excuse me?
For years now, you've used your church  to help a powerful drug g*ng  launder their money.
I'm curious.
How many Hail Marys does it take  to wash away something like that?
I'm sorry, my son, I don't know what you're talking about.
“Drug g*ng”?
Hmm, Mara Tres.
It's an open secret  you have an arrangement with their leader, Halcon Zelaya.
He makes large donations to your parish  and you return them to him clean, minus ten percent.
Now, to your credit, you use the bulk of that money  to make improvements to your church  and its ministry with the poor,  but I'll wager you're the only priest on the planet  with a canary yellow Porsche in a secret garage in Mount Kisco.
If everything you are saying were true...
I would be a very dangerous priest, wouldn't I?
I need you to get a message to Halcon.
You tell him Sherlock Holmes  says a w*r with SBK isn't necessary.
He'll have their territory soon enough.
What does that mean?
It means my partner and I declared w*r on them first.
We're working with the police to dismantle them.
We just need a little more time.
Halcon knows me and he knows my methods.
When I say SBK will be gone, he can take that as a fact.
And when...
can I tell him  that you have set your sights on him?
The message, see that he gets it.
I'm sorry.
I think what happened to these people is a tragedy,  but I don't know them.
Look closer.
I've been very patient with you people,  but enough is enough.
I don't appreciate  you coming into my office.
I don't appreciate you showing me images like these.
GREGSON: Cut the crap, okay?
We know you run SBK.
And if you didn't want to have to deal with visits like this  or look at pictures like that,  you probably shouldn't have poisoned your own brother.
Heavy is the head, huh?
Bonzi hasn't been gone 24 hours  and another g*ng has already declared w*r on you.
It's got to be a record.
Okay, let's pretend you're right about me.
I'm the head of a street g*ng that got att*cked  by another street g*ng last night.
Things like that can't go unanswered.
They can and if you want to keep running SBK, they should.
Explain that.
Wars like the one Mara Tres is trying to start, they're messy.
Disruptive.
You can't hide in the shadows anymore.
You got to get down in the trenches, get your hands dirty,  but, Tyus, remember...
we're already gunning for you.
If you order some sort of retaliation,  do you think it's gonna get easier  to hide who you really are or harder?
(chuckles)
If I were the leader of SBK,  you'd have given me a lot to think about.
But since I'm not, I can only pray that  the police find the people behind all this bloodshed  quickly, because you're right.
Wars like the one you're talking about, they get messy.
Police could get k*lled,  maybe even civilians.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
...I got a real job to do.
Well, this is unexpected.
I found your little mystery boxes downstairs.
I'm curious.
Which one will you open tonight?
What do you think you'll find?
Why are you here?
I'm here because I've realized  this isn't gonna work.
I love you.
I want to help you, but you won't let me.
This is helpful, is it?
Coming here?
Coming to the places I work?
Why won't you tell Joan about me?
Because you're none of her concern.
You're a terrible liar.
This is your last chance, Sherlock.
Do the right thing.
Do what needs to be done.
Or what?
Or you'll never see me again.
(doorbell rings)
Gentlemen.
Halcon got your message.
He wants to see you.
♪ Rob a bank before the day I go broke ♪  ♪ Let's see how much money we can take ♪  ♪ Is this only answered when they croak?
♪  ♪ Show me how much money you can make ♪  ♪ Rob a bank before the day I go broke ♪  ♪ Let's see how much money we can take.
♪  I appreciate not being put in the trunk this time.
Me and my men won't be here for very long,  so who cares if you know where you are?
I hoped my message would convince you  that additional bloodshed wasn't necessary,  but there appears to be a dead body in that box.
See?
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
Because you keep getting things wrong.
You think I got somebody from SBK in that box,  only I don't.
You think we started a w*r with those boys last night,  but we didn't.
The three men who att*cked the party  had very distinctive facial tattoos.
You're not listening.
I'm not saying we didn't do it.
I'm saying we didn't start it.
What happened last night,  that was retaliation.
For what?
(lid creaks)
My sister.
Carmen.
Yesterday, this box ends up outside the house  of an attorney I know.
He does real estate.
Finds places for us to put our money.
I didn't think anybody knew about him.
But, obviously, SBK did.
Somebody taped a DVD to the outside...
wrote “Halcon” on the sleeve.
This thing that I do...
she didn't have nothing to do with it.
Her soul, it was...
It was clean.
Thanks for sending me your message.
Now I got a message for you.
Stay out of my way.
And tell your people to let me do  what I need to do to SBK.
Because I promise you...
I'm not gonna stop until every last one of them is dead.
(frightened sobbing)
My name is Carmen Zelaya.
This message is for my brother, Julio.
“You have disrespected SBK.
“For years you have gone where we told you not to,  “and you have taken what is ours.
“It stops today.
Today we take something from you.”  Is that the whole thing?
Yeah.
There didn't appear to be any fingerprints on the disc,  but it should go to the lab all the same.
You said you saw the body?
I did.
After two days in the box,  the features had distorted somewhat,  but there was no doubt it was the woman in that video.
She'd been stabbed in the heart.
GREGSON: Someone kills this guy's sister,  sends him her in a box,  and he doesn't call the police?
Is he crazy?
Among other things.
He was a violent psychopath before Carmen's m*rder.
Now her death has inspired a madness  which would flatter Ivan the Terrible.
We should get ESU over to that garage.
You can, but he made it quite clear  he would not be staying there.
By the time they get there,  him and his men and his sister  will be long gone.
What do you mean his sister will be gone?
He plans on keeping her remains with him  until SBK has been eradicated.
Why?
As a reminder to his men and to himself  that there can be no mercy,  that SBK must pay for what they've done,  and pay horribly.
Assuming they're even the ones who k*lled her.
The last few days, we've had SBK on the run.
They're weaker than they've been in a long time.
So why would they start a w*r with a g*ng  as powerful as Mara Tres?
And if they did, why didn't they choose  a safer place to have their party last night?
We're talking about a street g*ng, not an investment bank.
They can't always be expected to make the right play.
Actually, I agree with Watson.
I think SBK's being framed.
By who?
By another g*ng-- someone who'd benefit  from the two of them destroying one another.
Or a faction inside Mara Tres that's pushing Halcon  to take action against their rivals.
Whoever it is, I think the ball is  squarely in Tyus Wilcox's court.
I want to have another chat with him.
HOLMES: Let me guess, you've never seen her before.
Just as you didn't order Shinwell's death,  and you didn't spike  your brother's cocaine stash.
You people keep talking to me like I'm a gangbanger.
But I've told you before, I'm a businessman.
GREGSON: Enough.
You don't want to say out loud  that you run SBK-- we get it.
But ten people are dead, and two of them are kids.
So if we double-pinky promise not to arrest you  for saying something we all know is true,  are you finally gonna start talking to us like a man?
Halcon really thinks we k*lled her?
He does.
About ten years ago, Bonzi came to me,  said he needed my help.
He'd only been running SBK a couple years.
He thought he might be in over his head  on a few things, so I gave him some business advice.
It worked.
He started coming to me more and more.
I started treating him like any other client.
In exchange for helping him,  I took a percentage of what he made.
You're a consulting gangster.
Eventually, we became partners.
But the partnership was predicated on certain rules.
One of those rules was do not mess with Halcon Zelaya.
SBK and Mara Tres have been involved  in multiple skirmishes over the years.
That's different.
That's business.
Halcon gets business.
What we didn't want was for things to get personal,  because we couldn't win.
Not against that kind of crazy.
We never would have signed off  on hurting his sister.
Well, as a matter of fact, we believe you.
We think your g*ng is being set up.
The question is, by whom?
You have multiple enemies all over the city.
We do.
But I can't help wondering if the person who did this  is a friend.
Bonzi and I would hear rumblings every once in a while.
Some of our people thought we were too hands-off  when it came to Mara Tres.
Could be one of them that wanted to change that.
We're gonna need names.
I don't have any.
The things we heard came from our lieutenants.
They just wanted us to know there were bad feelings,  but they didn't give anyone up.
They didn't think it was that serious.
I'd say it's serious now, wouldn't you?
I'll talk to my guys,  see if they know anything.
Let's say they do.
Let's say they give you a name.
Will you tell us?
Will you tell Halcon?
I can't imagine either scenario would  go down very well with your constituents.
All that matters is ending the fighting.
Did you tell Halcon about me?
I did not.
But should the unfriendliness  between your two groups persist, perhaps I will.
As you say, anything to stop the fighting.
WOMAN: Carmen's dead, isn't she?
And that's why you're here?
When was the last time you saw her?
Tuesday?
Your roommate is gone for days,  but you don't call the police?
Our shifts are long, and they don't always line up.
And the way they schedule the nurses,  sometimes we go a whole week without seeing each other.
Tanya, you need to stop lying to me.
What?
You're out of tissues, your eyes were puffy  when you answered the door.
You've been crying for days.
You know something.
You're right, Carmen is dead.
Someone stabbed her in the heart.
Do you really want the person who did it  to get away with it?
Please, if I talk to the police,  they will k*ll me.
Who's “they”?
Who are you afraid of?
Mara Tres.
Carmen's brother runs Mara Tres.
You don't think he wants his sister's m*rder solved?
He wants to solve it his way.
He told me to keep my mouth shut.
His way got ten people k*lled  the other night.
You're a nurse, Tanya.
So was Carmen.
You really think she'd be okay with that?
(sighs)
It was three nights ago.
We'd gone out for coffee, and we'd just gotten back  when this...
this guy came up to us.
He was wearing a ski mask,  and he grabbed Carmen and put a g*n to her head.
He said that if I called 911,  he was gonna sh**t her.
He told me to call her brother  and tell him that she was gone,  that he'd be in touch.
Did you?
Next day, Julio came here with some men.
I asked him if he had heard from the kidnapper,  but he just told me to stay quiet about what happened.
He said that Mara Tres was handling it.
Did he say anything else?
Just that he knew who was behind it.
Another g*ng.
But that didn't make any sense to me.
Why not?
I grew up in Spanish Harlem.
I know what a gangbanger looks like,  how they move, how they talk.
And the guy that took Carmen...
(exhales sharply)
...he was different.
What do you mean?
He was dressed like a gangbanger,  basketball jersey, baggy pants.
But he didn't have any tattoos.
Nothing on his arms, nothing on his neck.
And he didn't look comfortable holding a g*n.
I don't know, maybe things have changed since I was a kid.
But if you ask me, he wasn't in a g*ng.
(door opens)
Hi, how'd it go with Tyus Wilcox?
Better than expected.
He seems to want to help.
He thinks it's possible Carmen Zelaya was k*lled  by a rogue member of SBK,  someone who wanted to settle things between the gangs  once and for all.
Was he thinking of someone in particular?
No.
He thinks one of his lieutenants might know more.
Well, maybe one of them can help me find  an SBK member who doesn't have tattoos.
Carmen's roommate was with her when she was taken.
She said the guy was wearing a mask,  but his neck and arms were exposed.
And he had zero ink.
So I've been looking at guys  from other gangs who don't have tattoos.
It's like they don't exist.
g*ng members and body art do tend to go hand in hand.
So, uh, there's gonna be a memorial service for Shinwell  this afternoon.
I think we should go.
You think that's wise?
He was a g*ng member.
Seems like an obvious place  for Mara Tres to launch another attack.
I know.
That's why I asked the captain if he could park  a couple of radio cars outside.
That should keep it quiet for a little while.
Will you go with me?
Yeah, of course.
(phone ringing)
Captain.
GREGSON: Tyus Wilcox is back.
Did he find a rogue member of SBK?
Matter of fact, he did.
Did he give a name?
Actually, he's giving us all the names.
Everyone who ever committed a crime for SBK.
He didn't come here to sell out one guy.
He came here to sell out his whole g*ng.
GREGSON: He showed up a couple hours ago  and said he wanted immunity.
Immunity from what?
Everything.
He's copping to helping run SBK,  poisoning his brother, you name it.
The Assistant D.A.
in there is Nelson Lewis.
He's gonna run for the top job in a couple years.
(chuckling): He can't believe his luck.
He told you he was making the deal?
He's got as much blood on his hands  as any criminal in this city.
Mr.
Lewis is willing to forget that  in order get himself elected, is he?
No.
He's willing to forget about that  to keep an all-out w*r from breaking out  between SBK and Mara Tres.
Wilcox is willing to testify  against every member of SBK who ever followed his orders.
That's got to be 150 collars, easy.
There'll be no more g*ng w*r  because there'll be no more SBK.
Did he say who m*rder*d Carmen Zelaya?
Guy named Duane Pryor.
He was one of the bangers that was k*lled  at the party the other night.
According to Wilcox,  Mara Tres k*lled his brother back in '06,  so he held a grudge.
(phone ringing)
Oh, sorry.
I got to tell Paige it's gonna be a late night.
Hey.
Duane Pryor was one of Shinwell's friends.
You knew him?
No, but when Shinwell started with the g*ng unit,  I read up on him.
His arms were covered in tattoos.
Well, that doesn't square with what Carmen's roommate told you.
That's because Duane Pryor didn't k*ll Carmen.
Tyus Wilcox did.
You're kidding, right?
Tyus Wilcox is serving up SBK on a platter.
He's going to help us prevent a w*r.
You want me to chuck all that while you investigate him  for one m*rder?
Would you be giving him immunity  if there wasn't the possibility of a g*ng w*r?
That's a moot point.
You wouldn't be.
Fine.
No, we wouldn't.
But Mara Tres put ten people in the morgue  the other night, that changes the equation.
I think her point is Mr.
Wilcox knew it would.
He k*lled Halcon Zelaya's sister  because he wanted the guy to go nuclear.
He was setting himself up for the best deal he could get,  and now, thanks to you, he's getting it.
Where do you get the idea  that he personally k*lled Carmen Zelaya?
BELL: Carmen's roommate saw her get abducted.
She described a suspect with no tattoos.
Try finding someone else in SBK who isn't inked up.
WATSON: My partner spoke to her a little while ago.
He played a tape of Tyus's voice.
She said it sounded just like the man she saw.
An ear witness.
That's nothing.
We're not saying we have him dead to rights yet.
But let us lean on him.
No.
I'm sorry, but no.
There's no way I'm gonna let you jeopardize a case this big.
And for the record, Mr.
Wilcox already offered testimony  regarding the m*rder  of Ms.
Zelaya.
Duane Pryor did it.
Mr.
Pryor is dead.
If you want to close Ms.
Zelaya's m*rder?
Consider it closed.
I don't want it closed, I want it solved.
Well...
I want a lot more than that.
Mr.
Wilcox is going to be deposed  on dozens of SBK murders, drug deals, bribery cases,  you name it.
I'm not gonna risk all that  by letting you talk to him again.
That isn't up to you.
If that's how you want to play it, fine.
Our bosses can get into it.
But I'm telling you right now  that the answer's gonna be the same.
(door closes)
This isn't right.
Try to look at the big picture.
You helped expose Tyus Wilcox.
If you hadn't,  he'd still be running SBK, not burying it.
After he testifies,  he's gonna get shipped off to the middle of nowhere.
You don't think he has cash stashed overseas somewhere?
He's gonna ditch his protection  and go live on a beach.
He belongs in prison.
I wish I controlled who got immunity, but I don't.
Listen, you've been working hard.
Go home, get some rest.
I can't.
I have somewhere I need to be.
(quiet music playing)
It's okay.
You can take a seat.
Somebody has to be first.
Um, actually, I thought I was running late.
I'm supposed to meet a friend.
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.
Hello?
TYUS: I know I'm probably interrupting  your friend's service, but I figured  it wouldn't be too crowded.
Not many people turn out for a dead rat.
That's funny, you calling someone a rat.
And, you know, there might be more people here  if your whole g*ng wasn't running for cover.
SBK isn't my g*ng.
It never was.
Just a way to make money, a lot of it.
But that's over now.
Time to turn a page.
How'd you get my number?
First time you came to see me, you gave me your card, remember?
Funny thing is,  I knew who you were before you even came through the door.
Back in the day, Shinwell was just another corner boy.
Eager, handy with a g*n, but not exactly leadership material.
Then he gets out of prison, and all of a sudden,  he's all ambitious.
He moves up, starts getting face time with top guys.
Me and Bonzi, we wouldn't let any of our people  take their phones into meetings.
Couldn't risk any conversations getting recorded.
They'd turn them over at the door.
And when somebody's new and hot to move up,  got to take a look, right?
Had to wonder why he had somebody named Doc  on speed dial.
(chuckling): He wasn't sick.
Then you turn out to be a police consultant.
I guess I just wanted you to know.
Everything that's happened these last few days?
It's because of you.
You got this ball rolling.
You're the reason Shinwell is in a coffin.
I'm also the reason you're going to prison.
If you think you can take your money and disappear,  you can forget it.
Whatever you say.
Doc.
(phone clicks)

Tortoise-shell comb.
Pliers with red handles.
(frightened sobbing)
My name is Carmen Zelaya.
This message is for my brother, Julio.
(exhales)
Didn't hear you come in.
How did it go with the assistant D.A.?
Watson.
Where were you this afternoon?
Beg your pardon?
It's a simple question.
I went to visit Carmen Zelaya's roommate.
I'm not talking about that,  I'm talking about Shinwell's service.
Where were you?
I lost track of time.
I'm sorry.
Watson.
No.
Whatever excuse you have, it isn't good enough.
It hasn't been good enough for weeks.
Well, what's that supposed to mean  ?
It means that I've needed you and you haven't been there.
All right?
I am sick of it, and now Shinwell is dead.
That's my fault, is it?
Actually, according to Tyus Wilcox,  it is my fault.
He called me this afternoon.
He said that he had Shinwell k*lled  because he found my number in his phone.
Sorry about that.
Are you?
You said that you would come with me.
I forgot.
You forgot?
You.
Are you kidding me?
You can remember  what you had for lunch on your fifth birthday,  you can remember how many stars there were  in the sky that night, but you can't remember  to come to a memorial service  for a friend that I cared about?
You didn't go because you didn't want to,  because Shinwell hurt you, and you just don't have it in you  to get over something like that.
You know, it's interesting to me.
The true source of your anger is Tyus Wilcox.
Couldn't be more obvious.
He's a cold-blooded k*ller,  and he's gonna get away with everything.
Shinwell was also a k*ller,  and he was also gonna get away with everything.
Or did you forget he shot his friend in the back 12 years ago?
Look, he's dead.
I'm sorry.
Tried to help him.
But the only difference between him and Tyus Wilcox  is that he was an imbecile,  and Tyus Wilcox is not.
Shinwell wrote this.
It's a confession to Jameel's m*rder.
He wanted me to give it to the police  after SBK was brought down.
He wasn't getting away with anything.
If you can't see the difference  between him and Tyus Wilcox...
HALCON: Ms.
Watson, I presume?
You and your partner got to quit  using my priest like an answering machine.
Then maybe you should stop using his church like an ATM.
What do you want?
I know who k*lled your sister.
The person who k*lled Carmen is serving as a witness  in a high-profile case for the city.
He's in protective custody, which means  he travels in an armored car,  he stays at a different hotel every night  and he has around- the-clock security.
So no matter how badly  you want to get to him, you can't.
But I can.
I can make him pay for what he did.
But I need your help.
What kind of help?
I need you to give me Carmen.
I've been watching the video you gave my partner.
I think she is the key to everything.
If I am right,  it's time for you to give her up.
You say you know who m*rder*d her.
Maybe I have my boys here beat his name out of you,  then we go and see how protective  his custody really is.
Or maybe you're smart enough  to wait until he has no protection at all.
If you help me, he goes to prison.
No armored cars, no rotating hotel rooms, no security detail.
He's just another convict.
I'm guessing you know plenty of people behind bars  who you could send to introduce themselves.
And you don't have a problem with that.
Not tonight, I don't.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
WOMAN: Sorry, I know you don't want to hear from me.
but, um, this won't take long.
Actually, I could, um...
I could do with someone to talk to.
Oh, Sherlock.
I'm afraid that time has passed.
What do you mean?
I mean, it's time for me to go.
I just wanted to say good-bye.
Please, if you want me to say it, I'll say it, okay?
The text that Detective Perkins received the other day,  that I claimed came from someone else, I sent it.
I sent it, and then...
forgot.
Sherlock, my love.
I'm sorry.
But it's too late for that now.
Everything that's coming,  you're gonna have to deal with it on your own.
(crackling)
What was that noise?
Where, where are you?
It's all right, Sherlock.
Tell me where you are.
I'm close, Sherlock.
I'm always close.
(panting)
GREGSON: Mr.
Wilcox,  Mr.
Richards, have a seat, both of you.
Uh, Captain, I'm a little confused.
The D.A.'s office told me  they already got what they needed.
My client's been deposed for 20 hours over the last two days.
Frankly, we could both use a rest.
Well, I hate to wear you out, but there's something  you need to see.
(crying): My name is Carmen Zelaya.
What is this?
WATSON: Those are the last few moments of Carmen Zelaya's life.
That video was given to her brother, Halcon Zelaya,  the man who runs Mara Tres.
It's the reason ten people  were k*lled at an SBK party a few nights ago.
BELL: Your client's been granted immunity  for an awful lot, Mr.
Richards.
But he doesn't have immunity for k*lling her.
Excuse me?
Uh, I don't know what kind of ambush  you think you're pulling...
WATSON: Quiet.
You're gonna miss the most important part.
You see that jump?
The tape stops, and then runs again.
RICHARDS: Yeah?
So after the jump, there's blood on her lip.
The first time I saw it, I thought the person  who was making the tape stopped recording to hit her,  to make her say what they wanted.
But it's strange.
The tape keeps running,  but her lip never swells.
There's no redness or abrasion near her mouth, either.
So it made me wonder:  could there be another explanation for that blood?
I couldn't know for sure,  until an anonymous tip led the police to the location  of her body last night.
GREGSON: The M.E.
found exactly  what Ms.
Watson thought he would.
Carmen's lip was fine.
There was no cuts, punctures or bruises.
The blood in the video wasn't hers.
It was the k*ller's.
You can see  the restraints on her wrists are different.
The guy who was holding her hostage  had to tie her back up  because she wriggled free and bit him.
WATSON: She was a fighter, wasn't she, Tyus?
BELL: The M.E.
wasn't able to recover any DNA  from Carmen's mouth-- you did a pretty good job  pouring bleach in there.
But only pretty good.
There was still some in her throat.
WATSON: Could there be another explanation  for your blood in her esophagus?
Or maybe you'd like to prove to us  that you don't have any bite marks anywhere.
RICHARDS: You are getting  way ahead of yourselves.
If you tested his DNA without a warrant,  that is an unlawful search.
You didn't have permission...
We did, actually.
As part of your immunity deal,  you were required to provide a DNA sample.
The D.A.
wanted to check it  against all old, unsolved SBK murders.
BELL: Your client has admitted  that he suggested certain crimes,  but he claimed he never carried out any himself.
That was probably true, until this week.
I'm still covered.
You said I have immunity for everything.
I have immunity.
You had immunity.
The other day, you told a New York D.A.,  under oath, that Duane Pryor k*lled Carmen.
That was a lie.
GREGSON: You perjured yourself, Mr. Wilcox.
That voids your deal with the State of New York.
We can use the testimony you've already provided  to roll up your g*ng.
And now, we can send you to prison with them.
WATSON: Between all the people that you ratted out,  and Halcon's friends on the inside,  maybe you'll get lucky and spend the rest of your life  in solitary confinement.
WOMAN: Sherlock?

The little tests you devised,  the ones you thought would help your memory,  wrapping boxes and trying to remember what was in them,  they weren't enough, Sherlock.
You're not well.
And I would've done anything to get you to do the right thing.
You understand that, don't you?
Yeah, well, you didn't do anything, it was me.
