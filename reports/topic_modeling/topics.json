You just seemed a little off these last couple of days. I know it wasn't the credit. You and Holmes don't care about that stuff, but... whatever it was... You know what? She just got excited.

Where is this gentleman, Billy?\" \"In the waiting-room, sir.\" \"Show him up when I ring.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"If I am not in the room, show him in all the same.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Watson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly to his companion. \"Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible. This is a desperate man, who sticks at nothing. He may have come to murder you.\" \"I should not be surprised.\" \"I insist upon staying with you.\" \"You would be horribly in the way.\" \"In his way?\" \"No, my dear fellow--in my way.\" \"Well, I can't possibly leave you.\" \"Yes, you can, Watson. And you will, for you have never failed to play the game. I am sure you will play it to the end. This man has come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine.\" Holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines. \"Take a cab to Scotland Yard and give this to Youghal of the C.I.D. Come back with the police. The fellow's arrest will follow.\" \"I'll do that with joy", ". Look at the noises on the moor at night. There's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What's he waiting for? What does it mean? It means no good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry's new servants are ready to take over the Hall.\" \"But about this stranger,\" said I. \"Can you tell me anything about him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was doing?\" \"He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing away. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that he had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing he could not make out.\" \"And where did he say that he lived?\" \"Among the old houses on the hillside--the stone huts where the old folk used to live", ". Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\" \"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling. Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. \"Yes, I did bang out of the house,\" she said, \"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.\" \"Your father,\" said Holmes, \"your stepfather, surely, since the name is different.\" \"Yes, my stepfather"], "2": [". It could not have been clearer. He wants me to understand that as long as you're in my life, you can and will be used against me.

Listen, whatever really happened three years ago, I will help you. But first you need to tell me why you think Sherlock k*lled Maria. I'll do you one better. I'll show you. Sherlock was right.

Do you know how soon he'll be here? Uh, maybe 45 minutes. I'll come back another time. I prepared what I want to say to Sherlock. I timed it, so I know how long it'll take. And if I don't know how long it'll take, I won't know when I'll get back to my office or what time I'll finish my work, and I won't like that. Hey. When did you get back? Just arrived", ". Okay. Watson: Sherlock, it's me again. Your father is gonna be here any second. You said you'd be here. Call me back. Hey. Morning. I was in the neighborhood. That's so sweet. Please, come in. Is, uh, Holmes here? No. He got up early this morning to work on a project, but he'll be back soon. Kind of figured you'd be with him... all the time right now.

Thank you for your time, gentlemen. Hey. It's me. Shinwell did sell his toolbox and a few other items at a pawnshop near his building. So, you were right. He's on the run. Call me when you can.

He says he must see you this very minute.\" The message was unnecessary; for the set, cruel face of the man himself was looking over the servant's shoulder. He pushed the bartender out and closed the door on him. \"So,\" said he with a furious glance at McMurdo, \"you got here first, did you?

You said you had something to tell me? You and your fellow \"appreciators of specialness\"-- I think there's a better than average chance you've been infiltrated. What? Arthur West thought there was a mole in MI6. Judging by everything that's happened over the last few days, I think he might've been right. Whoever's took his arms wanted those numbers. West thought they were proof of the mole's existence", ". So, whenever Afkhami wanted to communicate with anyone related to his spy work, he'd plug his phone into one of these jacks... and the scrambler would have prevented Arthur West or any snoop from making out a single word of their conversations. Here. I don't understand. If West couldn't make out what Afkhami was saying, then... how did he know there was a mole in MI6? You know, I believe I know precisely how. West used that to monitor the calls between the mole and Afkhami"], "69": [". Show me a t*rror1st who doesn't want to b*mb us. We got to assume we're the target. KOHLER: My people have sophisticated equipment. It might be able to detect the plutonium. So, uh, we'll spearhead the search. GREGSON: We'll look into the robbery, see if we can find out who stole the plutonium, and maybe figure out where it went. Excuse me a moment. You okay? Yeah. The, um, the light in there was just bothering my eyes. It's possible I overdid it today. Let's get you home", ". Amberlin, he didn't have enough plutonium on hand for a full-scale nuclear w*apon. Agent Kohler fears a dirty b*mb. Yeah. Take a conventional expl*sive, you coat it with plutonium, and then you set it off. It would spread the plutonium far and wide, poison thousands of people. It would contaminate the blast area for decades. GREGSON: If there is a b*mb out there, it could be headed anywhere. But let's face it, this is New York. Show me a t*rror1st who doesn't want to b*mb us", ". To do what? To find my plutonium. You were right, about everything. I went to Japan, I bought plutonium illegally and had it smuggled back into the States. About a week ago, it was stolen. It could be it was just a little corporate espionage-- some other lab working on an LIPC, trying to set us back-- but I don't think I'm that lucky. If it was t*rrorists, then we're all in trouble. 'Cause they made off with enough plutonium to k*ll hundreds of thousands of people"], "70": [". The second round began just a few months after the two of you were released. Which means either one of you could have been the original bomber. We know you and Nathan were close in prison. You shared food, contraband. Wouldn't be hard to imagine you sharing other things, too. Secrets about building bombs, for example. Watson: Now, one of you was the bomber before you went to prison", ". So, you aren't friends, he never said anything about the Bensonhurst Bomber? Not to me. Okay. So, you've been out for the past few weeks, right? How's it going? Well, I live in a halfway house. I empty buckets of spit for a living... ...but I could be dead. You know that better than anybody. You think of anything. It's good to see you. Yeah, it's me. I know you said never to call you, but the police came by to see me. They want to know about the Bensonhurst Bomber. We need to talk", ". Things may be looking down for the Bensonhurst Bomber, but they're looking up for Nathan Resor. What do you mean, he \"beat out the competition\"? Well, apparently, he was bidding against some competing property in Queens. The people pushing that site bowed out a few hours ago. Nathan's been in overdrive ever since. Thanks for the update. Want to share it with the class? When Nathan's ex told me about the project, she did not mention he was in direct competition with anybody"], "71": [". No. But we're not complete idiots. We did check behind the mask, and there was no g*n there. I need to examine this room. Well, this is not our case. Pendry's not gonna just let us walk in there. Well, he will when I tell him that I almost caught his enemy Lestrade, and I found a su1c1de note that he was writing in which he indicates his intention to m*rder Lawrence Pendry. But I haven't written any su1c1de notes. Not yet you haven't. PENDRY: \"I die knowing that I brought justice to Mary", ". He cleaned the scene quite meticulously. Yeah, I passed DCI Hopkins on the way in. He didn't seem very happy. He knows I've been helping Lestrade. He wants me to give up his location, but I would prefer not to until his case against Pendry has been made. And yet... I don't suppose you found a 3D printer in here? Pendry obviously destroyed that ages ago. Why obviously? Ginn is six-foot-four. He has at least two stone on Pendry", ". So, um... I just, I-I-I wrote some... I wrote some things... Hello. ...down. It says here that... Pendry had this handyman, this guy called Nick Ginn. and he was a small-time villain, and we had him in for questioning. But he had an alibi the night of the m*rder. All right, now it says that he bought a 3D printer one week before Mary Pendry died. Pendry paid him to buy the printer. And then he built the g*n. Hm"], "72": [". I was for most of the evening. Then the captain called and told me that the severed ears Gordon Cushing received were a DNA match for Sarah's. You're kidding. That's me, Watson. Joke machine. So, Sarah Cushing is alive? She is, or at least she was as of yesterday. Gordon will be paying for her safe, if earless, return presently. The NYPD will be watching. And since they hardly need the assistance of two consulting detectives to execute a simple ransom exchange... Balancing exercise? How'd you.", ". And she was cremated. So I don't know whose ears Gordon Cushing got in the mail the other day, but they weren't hers. WATSON: Oh. You're still up. Gordon Cushing received a pair of freshly severed ears in the mail two days ago. They were a DNA match for hairs taken from a brush believed to belong to Sarah Cushing. Only the brush wasn't hers. Gordon says it could only belong to Kelly Tasker, aka Kendra, only she's been dead for years. Obviously, the ears weren't hers", ". The meeting's gonna start. Let's go. Hold on. Hmm? You know that woman? I think we both do. She's had a bit of work done, but not enough to conceal her true identity. At least not from me. It's Sarah Cushing. Yeah. Alive. And not in the least bit kidnapped. And if I'm not mistaken, in firm possession of both of her ears. You're right. I am Sarah Cushing. I was her, anyway. I go by Allison Drake now. I have for years.

You thought you were getting the only Wutai Pingtung orchid in the world for a virtual steal. Only Mr. Dubrovensky never delivered", ". What about the Wutai Pingtung orchid? I'm sorry. What? You are very good at feigning innocence. Perhaps it's all that lying about the bees. Clay Dubrovensky was found m*rder*d yesterday. Now, my colleagues checked his Internet history, 'cause they thought it might have had something to do with his purchase of the orchid. Instead, we found record of him selling it. To you", ". Perhaps he was k*lled over one you cannot. Autopsy report on Clay Dubrovensky. I am now quite certain the SDS did not k*ll him. Still think he died over a flower? As I explained, this is no mere flower. This is the Wu... Wutai Pingtung. It's rare. I get it. An honest politician is rare. A marriage worth the bother is rare.

What are you talking about? I'm talking about one of the most in-demand natural resources on the planet. Sand is an essential ingredient in concrete, detergent, silicon chips, but its supply is finite. So those in the business of sand are always looking for new ways and new places to extract it.

BELL: Jindal's attorney sent us paperwork that seems to support his story. Topaz Valley Industries asked for and received a permit to extract the sand in the vicinity of the Maracott Bridge. HOLMES: However, when I compared them to samples of handwriting found at Mr. Garza's home, it was obvious they were not a match for the signatures that we received on the paper. Okay. So the Sand Mafia forged the paperwork", ". Who did? And why did they want Topaz Valley to think their sand mining wouldn't affect the Maracott Bridge? What? If the Sand Mafia didn't k*ll this man and they didn't forge the signatures, what else didn't they do? PICKERING: This is horrible. Romeo was a wonderful man.
