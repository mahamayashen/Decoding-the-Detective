Previously on Elementary: The Nose.
He’s an Irregular  I’ve used from time to time.
His sense of smell outpaces even my own.
Sherlock Holmes, meet Sir James Walter,  deputy chief S.I.S.
I anticipated that without Moriarty  her group would fall apart.
Someone else has taken over.
I did it for you, Sherlock.
You and Joan.
So your only recourse  was to become head of an organization  which murders for profit.
How else would I dismantle it?
Your name is Vanja Borozan.
You are a high-priced assassin.
Who hired you to k*ll my father?
I understand that her FBI handlers  lost track of her some time ago.
She’s back, son,  and she wants what’s hers.
Moriarty.
(siren whoops)  (indistinct chatter)  Hey.
Just you?
Yeah.
I got your message while I was out.
I actually thought that Sherlock would get here before me.
Don’t get me wrong.
No one I’d  rather linger over a two-day-old corpse with.
WATSON: Two days?
Neighbors noticed the pizza  had been sitting there a while, got concerned.
MLI says he’s been dead about 48 hours.
Victim’s name was Gilbert Pham.
He’s a lawyer at Kress & Howell,  one of the big accounting firms.
"VP, Discovery."  Yeah, they go over the books  of companies involved in deals,  vet mergers, things like that.
Talked to the pizza shop.
Cashier says Pham was a regular,  and it was definitely him who placed the order.
That was 9:00 p.m.
night before last,  so we know he was still alive then.
Home invasion gone bad?
I’d say that’s what we’re supposed to think.
Kitchen door window’s busted from the outside.
We found the bolt unlocked.
Place has been tossed.
No money or loose valuables left behind.
But if someone broke that window and then opened this door,  the door would have swept the glass aside,  so this was done for show.
We also found a car service voucher  in Pham’s pocket.
Says they dropped him here at 7:00.
That’s two hours before he ordered the pizza.
I don’t know about you and your partner,  but when I get home, shoes and tie come off  as soon as I’m in the door.
So you’re wondering what happened in the two hours  between when he got home and when he was k*lled.
Did you notice these scratches?
I saw those bruises on his wrist.
I’m guessing that he spent some of that time  handcuffed to this chair.
Could be this whole  "home invasion" angle was just a distraction  to keep us from looking at his computer.
I’ll have CCS go over it, find out what kind of work  he did on it the night he died.
All right.
I’ll call Sherlock again.
(buzzing)  You can’t be certain that it was Moriarty  who hired Vanja Borozan to k*ll you.
Plenty of people want you dead.
Most of my life, I’ve wanted you dead.
No doubt.
But even you must be able to see  the sense in what I say.
Borozan trained in Moriarty’s camp.
I’ve made it my mission for the last two years  to destroy her empire.
That she should eventually  turn her attention to me was inevitable.
So, did every last one of her handlers die during her escape?
’Cause you’d think someone would have notified me.
As I understand it, she simply slipped through their fingers.
No bloodshed.
Makes one think she could have done it at any time.
I wouldn’t be too harsh on your FBI contacts.
The Bureau tried very hard to keep a lid on it.
Losing a prisoner as important as Moriarty, well...
must be quite an embarrassment.
What’s your excuse for not telling me?
I haven’t known for long.
I will, of course, need to verify all of this.
Of course.
Once you have, I’ll need your help.
I hoped I would never have to make this request.
We can both imagine how many lives would be lost  should she ascend to her former power.
And no one knows her better than you.
What’s the request?
Moriarty intends to k*ll me.
I need your help to k*ll her first.
♪ ♪  ♪ ♪  (knocks)  SIR WALTER: You’ve been asking a lot of favors  of us lately, Holmes.
My time working for British Intelligence  may have been brief,  but I’d say I’d earned a few chits.
Indeed.
Per your request,  the personal effects of Vanja Borozan.
Everything we found on his body  or in his hotel room.
So far, our boys have failed to identify  whoever was paying his bills,  but I would not be surprised if you have greater success.
I’ll let you know what I find.
Holmes.
The last time we met,  I expressed my condolences  on the death of your brother.
But that time, they were  empty words, as you and I both knew that he was alive.
I am sorry for your loss.
MAN:To Washburn Tobacco  and Summit-Stow Distributors.
(indistinct chatter)  Congratulations, Kip.
You’re about to be a wealthy man.
(chuckling)  BELL: Sorry to interrupt.
We’re looking for Aldo Ventura.
That would be me.
Is there a problem, Officer?
Detective, actually-- Marcus Bell.
And I wouldn’t sign those contracts  if I were you.
We’re pretty sure  your discovery lawyer gave this merger his blessing  with a g*n to his head.
BELL: Summit-Stow Distributors is a tobacco wholesaler.
Is that right, Mr.
Lowell?
So you buy cigarettes from the big companies  and sell them to retailers.
Only now you’re about to become  part of a big company.
That’s right.
(groans quietly)  Are you all right, Mr.
Lowell?
Yeah.
I’m sorry.
I, uh...
I took a couple of lorazepam  for the flight in from Ohio.
For antianxiety.
Also, I drank some champagne, so...
Should you be signing contracts in your condition?
We’ve already read them.
They’re very good for us.
LOWELL: Think what I just don’t get  is why you think one of us k*lled Gilbert Pham.
So you knew Mr.
Pham?
Yeah, we spoke.
He worked at the accounting firm  that Washburn hired to go over our financials.
Mr.
Pham logged into his firm’s network from home  the night he was k*lled.
He filed a report that gave this merger his sign-off.
WATSON: And since Pham was hired by Washburn  to vet the deal, it seems likely  there was some bad news in your books  that one of you was worried about.
So you forced Pham to give the okay, and then k*lled him.
You’re looking at the only four employees at Summit-Stow  with any financial stake in this merger.
And we all flew in together this morning.
LOWELL: I can personally vouch  that we were all in Akron three nights ago.
BELL: We’re listening.
This is a m*rder investigation.
We don’t take alibis at people’s word.
You seem unimpaired.
Who are you?
Name’s Tim Darsha.
LOWELL: Tim’s one of  our sales managers.
Lamar over there is the other.
And you’re the president of the company,  so why did you look to him for permission to speak?
(chuckles softly)  I didn’t.
He didn’t.
Sorry.
You were saying?
Your alibi.
We’d heard from Washburn that Pham  had signed off and that our deal would be  finalized soon, so we started celebrating early.
That night, we all, uh,  met up at a hotel and...
...hired some entertainment.
You hired prostitutes.
BELL: All right, say that checks out,  and none of you were here the night of the m*rder.
Still could have hired someone.
A hit man?
Honestly, Detective, I wouldn’t know how.
So, obviously, we’ll have to wait  on a bunch of prostitutes in Akron  to confirm his story, but I believe him.
Lorazepam and alcohol is not exactly a truth serum,  but it would make sticking to a lie more difficult.
That was our forensic accounting team.
Gilbert Pham’s firm sent over his work.
They’re going through it.
Take a closer look at that sales manager, Darsha.
He had something to hide.
Where are you going?
More family business.
WATSON: Hey.
So, it turns out  "Tim Darsha" is a pretty common name.
But it looks like the one that we met  does not have a record.
You know, if your mom catches you with these,  she’s gonna make you smoke every single one.
(chuckles)  Forensic accounting finished going over  Gilbert Pham’s work.
According to them, Summit-Stow’s financials  were all in order.
Thing is, Pham went above and beyond  when preparing his report.
Among other things,  he also checked out  Summit-Stow’s loading dock records.
Judging from his notes, he thought  there was more inventory moving through the place  than the company’s cash flow accounted for.
Say the books showed Summit-Stow  bought 10,000 cases and sold 10,000 cases.
All the money adds up except, according to the loading dock,  they moved 15,000 cases in the same time.
So, where’d the other cigarettes go?
Interstate cigarette smuggling is a big problem, right?
So you think Pham stumbled onto a smuggling operation.
Smugglers buy cigarettes in lower-tax states like Ohio  and sell them in higher-tax places like here.
The difference is so big, they can clear  a hundred bucks a carton.
Now, the Akron PD tracked down the girls  the Summit-Stow guys said they partied with.
They confirmed that Mr.
Lowell and his team  were in Ohio the night Pham was k*lled.
But if one of the guys was working with smugglers--  say that sales manager, Darsha--  it could be the smugglers k*lled Pham  so they wouldn’t expose their racket.
So, what are these for?
The sheriff’s office enforces cigarette taxes  in the city, so I reached out.
They said a lot of cigarettes from Ohio  are showing up in bodegas in Brooklyn,  especially around Fort Greene.
I asked them to send over some samples.
Any idea who the smugglers are?
So far, no luck nailing the local crew.
But those tax stamps and lot numbers are all unique.
I wanted to check ’em out.
They’re definitely coming out of the right part of Ohio  to have been distributed by Summit-Stow.
You know, my stepfather used to  smoke this brand when I was a kid.
Do you mind if I borrow some of these?
I think I might know a way to find the smugglers.
(door opens)  (sniffing)  (door closes, footsteps approaching)  Holmes.
Nose.
Imagine my surprise when Miss Watson  explained the particulars of your new case.
I barely can.
WATSON: Hey.
You saw my text about the cigarettes  that Marcus got from the sheriff’s?
I did.
I don’t recall anything about summoning The Nose.
Well, I noticed there was something off  about the smell of the cigarettes,  so I thought maybe it was a scent  they picked up in the trucks they were  smuggled in, or the place they were kept  when they arrived in New York.
Either way, I thought it could help us locate the smugglers.
Mm.
What?
Well, you could’ve asked me to smell them.
Well, you weren’t around.
What’s the big deal?
I mean, aren’t you guys friends?
Oh, we are.
It’s just, uh, tobacco  is the one area of olfaction  in which we’ve agreed to disagree.
Excuse me?
Some years ago, when Holmes wrote his monograph  on the 140 varieties of ash,  I pointed out that his distinctions between  Trichinopoly and Bird’s Eye were all wrong.
He’s never let it go.
Well, maybe if you’d told me  what you were up to the last couple of days,  I would’ve known I could count on you.
You’ll recall I discovered a threat to my father’s life?
He believes that the person  behind that threat is a certain woman.
The woman, in fact.
If you don’t mind, a little quiet, please?
I’m trying to smell.
(footsteps departing)  I don’t know if my father’s right.
As you know, there have been multiple attempts  on his life over the years.
It’s possible some other enemy  financed this latest one.
If your father is right  about who’s coming after him,  are we safe?
If you’re asking whether I think Moriarty  is sizing us up for assassination,  I would remind you that her organization’s one rule  is that no harm befalls me.
She prefers the world with me in it.
You seem to enjoy some tangential protection  due to our partnership.
That’s reassuring.
As I said, I am not convinced  she has anything to do with this.
What have you found out so far?
There was a MetroCard in Vanja Borozan’s personal effects  that ultimately led me to a garage that he had been renting.
In it, I found notes on  the routines of Father’s bodyguards,  along with schematics of his limousine.
Borozan was planning to k*ll him.
I also found six one-pound bags of coffee beans.
Untouched, just left on the table, along with  the receipt of their purchase.
I plan to visit the café where they were bought tomorrow.
It’s possible that’s where Borozan  and his contact were communicating.
If Moriarty is behind this,  your father wants you to help him k*ll her.
Will you?
(The Nose clears throat)  THE NOSE: I’m ready to report my findings.
Pine.
Star anise.
Grapefruit.
WATSON: Okay.
Uh, candles?
Cleaning supplies?
Hops.
Specifically Chinook hops,  grown in Oregon’s Willamette Valley.
I’d wager these cigarettes were transported in trucks  carrying hops from the Northwest.
Marcus mentioned that the cigarettes  had been turning up in bodegas in Fort Greene.
There is a craft brewery in that area.
Maybe that’s where the smugglers are bringing their shipments.
(quiet chatter)  They’re not just dropping stuff off a truck.
They’re moving a lot of inventory into the brewery.
OFFICER (over radio): Makes it more likely the owners  of the brewery are in on it.
Looks to me like this might be  the crew’s base of operations.
Copy that.
I’ll brief my team.
Your guys ready?
We might not get a better chance.
Two minutes out.
DISPATCHER (over radio): Major Case, Detective Bell on the air?
Detective Bell.
Go.
Detective Bell, call your command.
GREGSON: Hello?
Yeah, it’s Marcus.
Hold off on the takedown.
I got someone in my office you’re gonna want to talk to.
Who?
He says you met him earlier today,  only then he said his name was "Darsha."  His real name’s Bakshi.
He’s an A*F agent,  and apparently, you guys are about to blow up his op.
I’ve been undercover at Summit-Stow  almost three years now.
I take it from the furtive glances yesterday that,  at the very least, the company’s president, Kip Lowell,  knew about your presence.
He knows.
The other sales rep who was there doesn’t.
But the main reason I didn’t blow cover  is you surprised us.
Agent Evaneer and I  didn’t have a chance to discuss.
Agent Bakshi is based out of Columbus.
I’m here in New York.
Those guys that you were about  to move on yesterday-- small fish.
Part of a huge ring that moves product  all over the East and the Midwest.
Pretty unconventional, isn’t it?
A*F setting up shop inside an existing company?
New solution to an old problem.
Running a sting operation isn’t easy.
Cigarette smugglers don’t want to buy from just anyone.
You gotta have a business that they’ve heard of.
You gotta have someone with a history.
So you borrowed a history: Summit-Stow’s.
You buy cigarettes as them, you send them on  to smugglers in order to enact your stings.
GREGSON: So when our vic, Gilbert Pham,  noticed there was extra inventory  moving through the loading dock,  what he’d actually stumbled onto was your operation.
HOLMES: Which begs the question-- what did you  expect to happen when, uh,  Summit-Stow merged with a larger company?
We expected that Washburn Tobacco  would never even notice us.
Though, to be clear,  there was nothing that we were trying to hide.
I mean, not from the good guys, anyway.
Maybe not.
But Big Tobacco and the A*F aren’t exactly pals.
Did it occur to you that if Washburn found out  you were working inside their new acquisition,  they could just tell you to ship out?
Undo three years of undercover work?
It occurred to us.
And if Washburn had asked us to pack it up,  we would have made whatever arrests we could  and taken the case down.
We don’t get paid on performance, Captain.
And we certainly wouldn’t have k*lled someone  to protect a sting operation.
HOLMES: What about Mr.
Lowell?
He had a lot to gain from the merger, didn’t he?
Perhaps he thought your operation  was a secret worth k*lling over.
I don’t see it, but you can ask him.
We will.
Our colleagues are  on their way to speak to him right now.
LOWELL:Believe me, I wanted to tell you  all of this yesterday, but I-I just  didn’t think it had anything to do  with Mr.
Pham’s m*rder.
I still don’t.
And Agent Bakshi didn’t want to blow his cover.
Later on, he and Agent Evaneer  said that they were gonna tell you the truth.
I asked Maggie, my office manager,  to fly out here and show you what we showed Pham.
All of the accounting files  and the security videos from the loading dock.
Why the videos?
Because they clear everything up.
They show how Agent Bakshi  only sold his cigarettes to smugglers,  while our guys handled legitimate business.
Should I start with that?
Yeah.
English bulldogs.
MAGGIE: My babies.
I know calling them that  makes me weird.
Well, my partner  puts wool cozies on our tortoise.
You’re not even approaching weird.
BELL: So Pham asked you about the extra inventory?
LOWELL: Yeah, he flew out.
We explained the whole thing.
We thought it was resolved.
WATSON: Are you saying that you told Pham  about the A*F?
Don’t you think that was risky?
When Washburn Tobacco found out about it,  it could have blown the whole merger.
Yeah, I worried about that,  but once Pham started asking questions,  I didn’t think I had a choice.
The alternative was Washburn would think we were crooks.
That wouldn’t have helped the sale, either.
What did the A*F say once they found out  that Pham knew about them?
You didn’t tell them.
LOWELL: Maybe I should have.
I don’t know.
Truth is that those guys have always scared me.
So, you didn’t just volunteer  to let them set up at Summit-Stow.
They had something on you.
A few years back, Bakshi and Evaneer showed up with proof  that smugglers were already buying from us  and we were looking the other way.
Told me that they’d raise hell unless we’d cooperate.
Check this out.
Bakshi just finished a sale.
Few minutes later, this guy drove up.
Yeah, that’s Agent Evaneer.
Was he working undercover, too?
No.
Just Agent Bakshi.
Nice rides.
Nice?
That’s a BMW M7,  and that’s a Porsche 911 Turbo.
Those are $150,000 cars.
Maybe you could write off Bakshi’s car  to him wanting to look the part he’s playing,  but what’s Evaneer’s excuse?
The cash they take in is kept separate  from Summit-Stow, right?
Any idea where it all goes?
They turn it over to the government.
Don’t they?
What can I get you?
You the owner?
If I was, I’d have health insurance.
He’s on vacation.
Do you know where that picture came from?
Some of these are for sale.
I can let the owner know if you’re interested.
I’d like to get a message to her.
Tell her I want to talk.
WATSON (sighs): I didn’t hear you come in.
These are the videos you got from Summit-Stow, correct?
Can see what you and Marcus saw.
Aside from their fancy cars, Agent Bakshi’s shoes are Prada.
Agent Evaneer’s watch is a Patek Philippe.
It alone is worth more than their annual salaries combined.
Might be the most conspicuous "conspicuous consumption"  I’ve ever seen.
I did some rough math.
Based on the volume of cigarettes they’ve sold  and the fact that they’ve been up and running  for the last three years,  I’d say they’ve probably made about $30 million.
Have you been able to determine where any of it went?
I can tell you where it isn’t: in the hands of the government.
The captain reached out to the A*F in Washington.
Apparently, they told Bakshi and Evaneer  that they could keep the money  until the whole operation was wrapped,  and then voucher it all at one time.
If I’m right, that’s tens of millions  completely unsupervised.
Not on Summit-Stow’s books or the government’s.
And unlike every other time in human history  when someone was entrusted  with another person’s money without oversight,  the A*F assumed that these two  would not skim off the top to enrich themselves.
Not at all idiotic.
Now, if Gilbert Pham kept asking questions  about the cigarette sales  that were not on Summit-Stow’s profit statements,  there’s a chance he would’ve exposed what they were doing.
Giving these two large-living agents motive to k*ll him.
Police are looking for them right now.
The A*F has not heard from them since this morning.
Evaneer hasn’t been home,  and Bakshi checked out of his hotel.
Marcus is gonna tell us if there’s any news.
What about you?
Did you find anything  at that café you went to?
A painting.
One of hers.
That can’t be a coincidence.
It isn’t.
And it makes it a virtual certainty  that my father is right.
She’s trying to k*ll him.
So, Moriarty is somehow connected to that café,  and Borozan bought beans there that he never used.
It supports my suspicion that the café is a conduit  through which they exchange messages.
Buying the coffee beans is merely a cover.
And since Borozan was hired to k*ll your father,  Moriarty has to be the one who hired him.
It’s short of proof positive, I know,  but I’m quite convinced.
While I was at the café,  I left a message of my own.
I’m not sure if she’ll respond.
Or how.
She hasn’t written to me  in close to a year.
But I know several news  and social media sites that she  might use to contact me, so I’ll just  remain vigilant.
Say that works, she contacts you.
You never answered my question from last night.
What’ll you do?
Your father asked you to arrange  the m*rder of the woman that you love.
Is that something that you can do?
Don’t know.
A while ago, I would have laughed  in his face, but...
It is vexing.
What if you do nothing?
Just let them do what they do.
What do you think will happen?
I honestly have no idea.
But I do know that, given the resources  that each of them has at their disposal,  collateral loss of life could be immense.
I don’t think standing idly by and doing nothing is an option.
(cell phone ringing)  Hey, Marcus.
It was over before we got here.
Driver of that truck was asleep in his cab.
Heard two men yelling, followed by g*nf*re.
He’s the one who called it in.
Looks like Bakshi died pretty quick.
Evaneer took one in the gut, one in the leg.
From the looks of it,  managed to drag himself back to his car,  but he must have lost consciousness  before he could go anywhere.
And we’re sure they did this to each other?
Witness didn’t look till he was sure the sh**ting was done,  but he said they were the only ones here.
Did he hear what they were arguing about?
He said he heard one of them yell  "it wasn’t me" a bunch of times.
He couldn’t tell what "it" referred to,  but I have a pretty good idea.
We found this phone on the ground.
Bakshi’s was on him, so this must be Evaneer’s.
We haven’t cracked the password yet, but...
look at the last notification.
A bank transfer of $26 million  out of an account a few hours ago.
Looks like we found their slush fund,  or at least where their money was.
So, judging by the location,  the two of them were lying low.
Except Evaneer gets this message  from the bank, sees all their money’s gone.
They meet up, the accusations fly,  they’re both armed, so this happens.
That leaves us with two possibilities.
Either one of these men died lying to the other one...
...or someone else stole all their money.
Ballistics confirmed the slugs  the M.E.
pulled out of Bakshi and Evaneer  came from each other’s weapons.
So the two of them build up an unsupervised  $26 million slush fund,  then they k*ll each other over it  because each one thinks the other one stole it.
Looks that way.
But you guys think they were wrong?
Maybe.
We had the account info off Evaneer’s phone,  so I got a court order for the bank records.
The 26 million was transferred  out of the account yesterday afternoon  and into an account in the Caymans.
Whoever did it used one of the free  Wi-Fi kiosks in Midtown.
We also pulled  Bakshi and Evaneer’s cell tower logs.
At the time the transfer was made,  neither one was anywhere near that kiosk.
Which means someone else  did steal that money from both of them.
That’s one possibility.
Another is that one of them had a helper.
At the very least, it proves a third party  was aware of the slush fund.
And we’re still thinking  Gilbert Pham was k*lled to cover up  what was going on with that slush fund.
Yeah.
Bakshi had already alibied,  and we checked-- Evaneer was at his office  late the night of the m*rder.
Makes this third party our best suspect.
I’ve got detectives checking  the cameras around the Wi-Fi kiosk  they logged in from, but they could have been  in the back seat of a passing cab, for all we know.
So you’re not holding your breath.
Sherlock and Joan  have been going over the rest of the slush fund’s records.
We’re hoping something in there  might tell us who else knew about the account.
More transfers to the Caymans.
These all go into the same account as the 26 million?
HOLMES: They started off small about eight months ago.
The first was for a modest $5,000.
Then, over time, transfers got larger.
Prior to the emptying of the account yesterday,  they added up to just over three million.
Sounds like someone was testing the waters.
Siphoned off a little bit, then got bolder  when no one noticed.
We thought the same thing.
GREGSON: And this was going on  for months before Gilbert Pham started poking around.
So, if he discovered the slush fund,  he would have also discovered the theft.
So, who owns the account in the Caymans?
So far, the bank has opted to protect its client’s privacy.
I’ve reached out to a friend in George Town  who might be able to persuade them otherwise,  but, um, even if he does,  the owner may be hidden behind an alias  or a shell company.
We’ll just have to wait and see.
Right.
That explains this color.
Um, what about this other one?
BELL: Yeah, those are weirder.
They go back farther, starting about a year  after Bakshi and Evaneer got up and running.
Over a dozen transfers out of the slush fund,  ranging from around ten grand to 50 grand,  going to a handful of bank accounts  in cities all over the country.
Baltimore, Louisville, Tampa, Phoenix.
So far, we don’t know what those transfers are  or why those cities.
GREGSON: I think I can explain the cities.
Over the years, I’ve done a lot of  joint investigations with the Feds.
Every one of those cities has an A*F field office.
You think other A*F agents knew about the slush fund?
Maybe Bakshi and Evaneer were getting ripped off  by one of their own.
BELL: When examining Agents Bakshi and Evaneer’s slush fund,  we noticed a series of transfers going to cities  with A*F field offices.
We compared those transfers  to the two agents’ phone records.
Each one was preceded by a call  from your cell phone.
So?
I’ve shown you a lot of patience, Captain.
Sitting here, having this talk in an interrogation room.
You said this is about what happened to Bakshi and Evaneer.
What happened is they shot each other.
As far as we know, that’s true, but mainly,  we’re interested in the m*rder of Gilbert Pham.
Who?
WATSON: Pham was a discovery lawyer  hired by Washburn Tobacco  to vet the purchase of Summit-Stow.
We think he was m*rder*d  to keep him from digging too deeply  into Evaneer and Bakshi’s slush fund.
GREGSON: We honestly don’t know  why you were wiring money all over the country,  but whatever the reason, the timing  of those phone calls tells us you knew about the fund.
And since we already ruled out Bakshi and Evaneer  for Pham’s m*rder, that leaves you.
(snickers)  You people have it so wrong, I don’t know where to start.
Do tell.
I wouldn’t have k*lled anyone to hide anything.
You know what those transfers were?
Us doing good.
We used the money to fund other A*F ops.
How would you feel if every step you took here,  you had to run it through the DMV?
The number of targets we lost  waiting for Congressional funding...
I lost count.
Bakshi and Evaneer were sitting on all that cash.
I suggested we use it to cut some red tape.
So this was your idea.
Damn right.
Ho-Ho-Hold up.
You were using off-the-books money  from an ongoing operation to pay for...
what exactly?
Whatever our agents needed to catch the bad guys.
They’d call me,  I’d call the guys, and we’d make it happen.
Untraceable license plates, hotel rooms, vehicles.
Prada shoes, six-figure watches.
If those two were sticking their hands  in the till, that’s on them.
BELL: So...
humor us.
Where were you five nights ago  when Pham was k*lled?
Friday?
I was in Vegas  at a friend’s bachelor party.
I hear they have a lot of cameras there,  so I’m sure you can confirm it.
We’re gonna need your travel records  and the names of the friends you were with.
Did any of the agents you were funding  know the details of the account?
No.
Can you think of anyone else who knew about the slush fund?
They had a helper.
Someone who managed the account with them.
Did this helper have a name?
I heard them use a nickname sometimes.
"Bulldog will handle it," stuff like that.
Would you excuse us?
Do you remember Kip Lowell’s office manager  from the hotel yesterday?
Sure.
Maggie Foltz, right?
Yeah.
And remember her laptop?
Her wallpaper had a picture of her and her bulldogs.
I think she’s Bulldog.
Makes sense.
She knew about the undercover operation.
Since she handled Summit-Stow’s accounting,  the A*F guys might have  asked her for help with theirs, too.
You’re thinking she’s the one who embezzled  from the slush fund, then she m*rder*d Gilbert Pham  for asking too many questions?
BELL: I’m pretty sure she and Lowell  flew back to Ohio yesterday.
I’ll call the Akron Police, let them know  we want to talk to her.
(cell phone ringing)  I’d say we should keep the line clear, but it isn’t 1970.
Any word?
HOLMES: Not yet.
I’m not sure what sort of contact to expect.
You?
Well, best we can piece together,  the woman I texted you about, Maggie Foltz,  flew back to Akron with Kip Lowell  like nothing was wrong.
They got off the plane, they went their separate ways,  and no one’s seen her since.
Her car is still at the airport.
With $30 million in an account in the Caymans  and a full day’s head start,  she could be anywhere in the world.
Marcus is pulling her phone records  and her credit card history.
So we’ll go through those and see  if there’s any new activity.
Maybe we’ll get lucky.
(doorbell rings)  Was that the door?
It was.
Safe to say it isn’t Miss Foltz.
Well, be careful.
Mr.
Holmes.
How did you know I live here?
Do you always ask questions you already know the answers to?
Oh, you didn’t expect her to come herself,  did you?
She sent me.
Do you have a name?
It’s Ellory.
So, how did you come to be in Moriarty’s employ?
Does it matter?
I just recognize the tattoo on your shoulder.
It’s used by a Guatemalan amphetamine ring  to brand their drug mules.
Perhaps you think you owe her  for removing you from a bad situation.
Or perhaps you’re just unaware of how many more  bad situations you’ll help her create.
We’re all fish eating other fish, Mr.
Holmes.
I’d rather be swimming with the biggest one.
You said you wanted to talk, so talk.
It’s become clear that tensions  between your employer and my father  are coming to a head.
It should come as no surprise  that my father has asked me  to help bring about Moriarty’s death.
After slaving over the question for quite some time,  I’ve decided I’d rather discuss his.
(door opens)  (door closes, footsteps approaching)  More A*F agents.
These guys took money from the slush fund, too?
Specifically, agents working  out of the Charlotte, North Carolina field office.
Maggie Foltz’s phone records show one call  after she landed in Akron--  to a burner registered in Charlotte.
I reviewed surveillance footage from the Akron-Canton Airport,  and the last camera to pick her up,  she was headed to the private terminal.
Video in that terminal is lacking.
You think she got into a private plane?
I do.
Moreover, I think she had help.
There are no records  of her arranging that flight herself.
Whoever was on the other end of that call picked her up.
I believe she was extracted.
And since the call was to Charlotte  and all of those agents benefitted from her help before,  you think those are the best suspects for her accomplice.
It’s amazing to me how many of these guys were corrupt.
I was struck by the same thought when you described  Agent Hobbs’s unrepentant attitude.
All of these men-- Hobbs, Bakshi, Evaneer--  they saw themselves as the good guys.
Yes, they were breaking the law,  but it was okay because they were catching bad guys.
And it gave these men permission to commit their crimes.
And those markings?
HOLMES: An irony I discovered.
Despite these men’s belief  that the ends justified the means,  if the agents had any additional success  thanks to their slush-fund funding, it was short-lived.
Across the board,  within months of Bakshi and Evaneer handing out money,  arrest rates for all of the agents involved dropped.
Why?
I’ve got no idea.
Perhaps once they no longer had to work  so hard for funding, they got lazy.
You said the drop in arrests wasn’t right away.
When was it?
About 18 months ago.
That’s when Maggie Foltz  started working with Summit-Stow.
That means something to you?
Yeah.
I think I know why the agents’ arrest rates dropped.
And if I’m right, I also know how to find her.
Glad this worked out with your schedule, Mr.
Ventura.
Sure you’re a busy man.
(door closes)  You’ve met Miss Watson and Detective Bell.
Always happy to do what I can  for the folks who wear a badge.
Those are pretty words, and I’m sure  they’re mostly true.
I hope they are today.
Why wouldn’t they be?
Well, you know from when we met the other day  we’ve been investigating the m*rder of  your discovery lawyer, Gilbert Pham, right?
Were you aware that Pham  discovered an undercover A*F operation going on  inside Summit-Stow Distributors?
No.
I had no idea.
Turns out those agents were running  an unsupervised slush fund,  using it to finance other A*F operations,  circumventing Congress.
All sounds serious.
I don’t see what that has to do with me.
WATSON: Well, my partner and I found something strange  about the agents who took money from the slush fund.
All of their arrest rates dropped  once a woman named Maggie Foltz started helping them.
Now, before Maggie worked at Summit-Stow,  she worked at Washburn Tobacco,  which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
BELL: Maggie disappeared two days ago  after calling a phone number in Charlotte.
We went back through the private flight traffic  at Akron-Canton Airport for that day.
It wasn’t easy to spot until we knew  what we were looking for,  but one jet that flew in and out around the right time  is owned by a company that’s owned by a company  that you personally own.
WATSON: So Maggie was your mole at Summit-Stow.
You knew about the A*F operation.
Somehow, you found out about it,  and then you planted Maggie there  to keep an eye on it for you.
BELL: I don’t have to tell you  that Big Tobacco loves cigarette smugglers.
In high-tax cities like New York and Boston,  smuggled cigarettes are over half your business.
You provided illegal aid.
You helped the smugglers avoid the A*F  by tipping them to whatever activity  Maggie knew about.
You have proof to back that up, son?
Yeah.
We do.
That phone number Maggie called  to get your plane to come pick her up--  she called that same number from Akron  the day Gilbert Pham was k*lled.
And according to the flight records at both airports,  your plane made a flight from Akron to La Guardia  and back that night.
WATSON: Now, your pilot has already agreed to testify  that he took Maggie to and from New York that night.
And the flight times also fit the time frame in which  Gilbert Pham was held hostage and then shot.
Police also matched fibers they found in Pham’s house  to the carpet on your plane.
GREGSON: Now, I’m willing to believe  you didn’t know you were helping  a m*rder*r at the time, but you know it now.
I’ve already talked with the Department of Justice.
Washburn Tobacco is going to be slapped  with a penalty for aiding smugglers.
But the DOJ has agreed  to make that penalty smaller if you help us bring her in.
Thank you for coming.
Come in.
I was on my way to the airport when I got your call.
I take it you’ve come to a decision about my request?
Yes, I’ve done more than that.
I’ve exchanged messages with Moriarty.
Oh.
Naturally, I assumed you’d find  a way to contact her if you wanted to.
Didn’t expect it so quickly.
Where is she?
I have no idea.
What’s our next move?
I said I’d exchanged messages with her.
You’re jumping to conclusions  about the content of those messages.
First among them that you’re  going to like what I have to say.
I wouldn’t be so sure.
Go on.
She and I have agreed to an armistice.
A temporary cease-fire on both sides.
And how did you manage that?
I told her that should she succeed in assassinating you,  I would assume your role at the head of her former organization.
For the time being, she will remain inactive,  allow you to continue your work.
I believe she will honor our agreement.
And assuming she does, I expect you to do the same.
And how long is this cease-fire supposed to last?
Until you die of old age.
I persuaded her that won’t be long.
You realize, of course, that you’re just  staving off the inevitable?
I do.
You’re going to have to deal with her at some point.
And when that time comes, the way you’ve planned it,  I won’t be there to help.
And that’s as it should be.
When the time comes-- if it comes--  the problem of Moriarty will be mine and mine alone.
We’ll speak again.
Soon, I hope.
