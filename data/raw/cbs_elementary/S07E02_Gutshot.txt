WATSON: Previously on Elementary You have to tell the FBI.
If it weren't for you, my little girl wouldn't be a k*ller.
I'm the only one who could confess without going to prison.
MALLICK: The Brits won't extradite him.
They made that very clear.
He isn't allowed to set foot in the U.
S.
ever again.
Sherlock Holmes isn't America's problem anymore.
Everything that went down between you and Sherlock and Joan, - you got to get past it.
- Marcus No.
They never did anything but right by us.
I'm gonna call them tomorrow, apologize.
- Captain?
- BELL: Actually, it's me.
Marcus.
Sorry I'm calling like this.
The captain-- he's been shot.
It's bad.
(tires screeching in distance)
Banksy ain't got nothing on you, yo.
(brakes screech, metal crashing)
What the hell was that?
What you doing?
Calling 911.
Are you crazy?
Look at your hands.
They're gonna know it was you who did all that graffiti.
We can't just leave him here like this.
ARNOLD: He's a drunk driver, man.
He did this to himself.
No, man, look at his back.
I think that's a b*llet hole.
Whatever, man.
I'm out.
TREMAINE: Obviously I called.
The cops and the ambulance, they got there fast.
Then, all of a sudden, there was more cops and more.
I thought, sh**t.
This must be what it's like when a white dude gets shot.
I didn't know he was Five-O till later.
You know I told all this to the cops that came that night, right?
Yeah, but the sh**ting victim, he's my friend.
I wanted to talk to you myself.
I wanted to thank you.
Um, I need a minute, Tremaine.
Sit tight.
Hey.
I came straight from the airport.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
No, it's okay.
He's, uh, he's the one who found the captain.
I was just making sure the guys who talked to him the night of hadn't missed anything.
And?
Everything I told you when I called is everything we know.
Is the captain doing any better?
Same.
He still hasn't regained consciousness.
He keeps needing transfusions.
The docs think there may be something in there still bleeding.
They might have to go back in.
I want to see him, but I also want to help with the investigation.
Kind of figured you would.
Look, if you think it's gonna be a problem because of everything that happened last year Hey.
You're not the one who confessed to Michael Rowan's m*rder.
Sherlock was.
Anyone has a problem with you being here, they can take it up with me.
How is he, by the way?
Your partner?
Must've k*lled him to have to stay in London.
You have no idea.
But the deal he made with the FBI was pretty clear.
If he comes back to the U. S. , he gets arrested.
I'm gonna keep him in the loop, and he's gonna do what he can from there.
This isn't how I wanted to see you, but I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad I'm here, too.
(door opens)
HOLMES: Well?
Did he buy it?
Yeah.
He bought it.
Elementary 7x02 Gutshot WATSON: The gas isn't working, either.
I just spoke to Wiggins.
He assures me the utilities will be turned back on by this evening.
What about the furniture?
He said he was gonna rent us some?
As far as he's concerned, he's renting some for you.
He thinks I'm still in England.
Are we gonna have beds to sleep on tonight or not?
The furniture should arrive no later than 5:00 p. m.
Remind me why we're not staying someplace else?
This was more than just our home for six years.
This was our laboratory.
Our sanctum sanctorum.
Where else to tackle a case so important?
I don't know, someplace where there's with a working toilet?
Voil√É .
WATSON: I still don't understand why you wouldn't let Lin sell this place.
Anyone who sells real estate in New York when they don't have to is a fool.
Besides, this place is your inheritance.
Yeah, but still You said the captain's condition was unchanged?
What about the investigation?
I'm afraid the prognosis on that is also pretty grim.
All Marcus knows is what he told us when he called.
The captain was driving home from the precinct.
Somewhere along the way, he stopped, he got out of his car.
g*nf*re was exchanged.
He was shot once in the abdomen, once in the back.
He got back in his car, drove away and crashed it in Flushing.
So they still haven't identified the scene of the crime.
They don't know exactly where he was gunned down.
Could be he was tricked into pulling over for the sh**t, or he was ambushed when he stopped to run an errand.
Either way, the one thing that everyone can agree on is that it wasn't random.
I imagine there's something else everyone can agree on: a police captain, with decades of service to the NYPD, would have made literally thousands of enemies.
Our suspect pool is huge.
How's Marcus?
Okay, all things considered.
Did he mention the Marshals?
He reached out to them yesterday.
He told them that he was not gonna report for training next week.
He said that he didn't feel right leaving the 11th at a time like this.
Well, their loss is our gain.
(phone chiming)
It's Paige.
I texted her to see when I could go see the captain at the hospital.
She says I can come now.
I'd say you should join, but But I'm wanted by the FBI for m*rder.
It's just as well.
I'm going to retrace the path between the precinct and the crash site.
Any luck, I'll find the scene of the sh**ting as well.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Stay in New York.
If the feds realize you're here You didn't think I'd sneak through customs with a false passport, but I did.
Anyway, we're not planning on staying here for too long.
We'll find the captain's sh**t, point Marcus in his or her direction, and then go back to London.
Considering it's us, that should take, what, three days?
Four at the absolute maximum.
He calls me every time he's on his way home.
That was part of the deal when we got married.
I get that call, I know he's safe.
He made it through another day.
I don't have to worry about him anymore.
My phone rang the other night.
I relaxed.
Only it wasn't him.
It was Marcus calling to let me know So the day it happened, did he say anything about stopping somewhere on his way home?
No.
What about his recent caseload?
Did he mention any problems with anyone, any threats?
No.
But if somebody had threatened him, I don't think he would have told me.
He didn't like to bring that stuff home.
I didn't either, when I was on the job.
Have you even been home since all this happened?
Hannah's gonna bring me some stuff.
I'll be fine.
I like the hair.
It suits you.
Thanks.
I changed my look this year, too.
In case you couldn't tell.
Numbness in the legs?
It's MS, the gift that keeps on giving.
How's your partner doing?
He's good.
He wishes he could be here.
I know you two aren't cops, but your work is dangerous, too.
Make sure he takes care of himself while you're out of town, okay?
Thanks.
But I'm sure he's fine.
Anything?
Nah, man.
Nothing.
Ain't you gonna get up now?
Reenacting elements of a traumatic incident can help flesh out the memories of those who witnessed it.
But I told you, I didn't witness anything.
I didn't see the dude crash, I just heard it.
What is it you want me to remember, anyway?
A scent, a sound.
Anything that could help me identify where he was coming from before he crashed.
Like, if I smelled pizza, you'd go check out all the pizza places around here?
Did you smell pizza?
Nah.
It's just an example.
The man who was shot began his journey at the 11th precinct.
I've retraced that path twice now and haven't been able to identify where he was ambushed.
Why is it important?
Because there might be something there that could help me identify the sh**t.
DNA, a fingerprint.
- Can I go now?
- I paid you for the hour.
I know.
But I already told you everything I know.
Just like I told the cops twice.
I heard brakes, then a crash.
I found a dude lying on the ground and I called 911.
You said you heard brakes.
So?
You didn't mention anything about brakes before.
- Course I did.
- No, you didn't.
Also, there aren't any skid marks here.
The captain's car slammed into that column without slowing down.
Right.
I heard the brakes a few seconds before the crash.
How many seconds?
Maybe three?
Three.
Hey-- what?
You think those are from your friend?
Note the curvature.
He was traveling at a very high speed as he approached the corner, then he slammed on his brakes.
Dude was in worse shape than I thought.
He was going the wrong way down a one-way street.
Well, the fact that he was driving the wrong way as he fled for his life is not that surprising.
What is surprising is that these marks indicate he wasn't coming from the direction of the 11th precinct, but an entirely different direction.
We've been looking for the scene of the sh**ting along the wrong route.
(scoffs)
Guessing the power is still off.
HOLMES: I'm assured it'll be turned on by noon tomorrow.
You know, when a utility company says tomorrow, they really mean next week, right?
Where is all the rental furniture?
Delayed.
But have no fear.
I went to an army surplus store and got us a couple of cots.
New or used?
Does it matter?
How's the captain?
Bad.
Nothing's changed.
He's still in critical condition.
It's hard seeing him that way.
I take it you received my text.
So, you don't think he took his usual route from the 11th to his house the night he was shot?
The police assumed that he had because the place where he crashed his car was on that route, but in addition to the skid marks I found here, I also found a booted car here.
It had recently been sideswiped.
The paint chips in evidence suggest that the offending vehicle was a dark blue Crown Victoria.
Same as the captain's.
- Mm.
- Odds are he wasn't tricked into pulling over on his way home.
He stopped somewhere after work.
Somewhere at least one mile out of his way.
The problem is, there's no way of telling where he was coming from before he sideswiped that car.
He was heading south before he turned onto the street with the booted car.
So, Marcus gave me copies of everything the police have.
This is what the captain was wearing the night he was shot.
CSU took photos of it before they sent it to the lab.
They thought that was more blood, but the color looked off to me.
It's hard to tell from a photograph, but it looks more like a reddish dirt, maybe clay.
I think it's a mixture of both.
That is a baseball field.
Most baseball fields use a mixture of clay and dirt on their base paths.
What if this is where the captain was the night he was shot?
It's a .
380, just like the b*ll*ts that struck the captain.
So, the sh**t maybe stood here?
And he shot at the captain, who was where?
HOLMES: There.
Looks like not all the sh**t's b*ll*ts found the captain.
This must be from one that did.
So, he was shot here, returns fire, and then he runs off that way, stumbles on the base path, got into his car and sped away.
I need to call Marcus.
Tell him we found the crime scene.
Well, we could or we could stay here, try and find out what the captain was doing here that night.
Obviously, there wasn't a game being played.
There would've been dozens of witnesses.
Someone would have called the police.
(sniffs)
What is it?
Smell that.
Is that lye?
Excuse me.
(Holmes grunts)
Well, I can't be certain but I think this has something to do with the captain's visit.
Kind of feel bad putting him back in another wall.
Good news is we were able to make an ID.
Tim Bledsoe.
Local kid, went to community college in Queens.
Bledsoe.
Do I know that name?
You might remember his missing person poster.
His mother reported his disappearance eight months ago.
The detective who handled the case pulled his file so I could check a few things.
Dental records are a perfect match.
My report's got standard notes on decomp.
Cause of death was multiple g*nsh*t wounds.
You pulled a .
380 slug from his skull.
Same caliber they took out of the captain.
So, fits what we thought.
He went to look for Tim's body, but the k*ller made sure that didn't happen.
Be nice if we could ask him how he ended up at the baseball field.
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.
We should go, too.
Got our work cut out for us.
Figure I'll invite everyone mentioned in the missing persons file down for a chat.
Talk to the construction company that built the snack bar at that field, too.
I'll go talk to his mother.
If she's the one who reported him missing, then she's had longer than anyone to think about who would hurt her son.
So, what'd you want to ask me, Mr. ?
I'm sorry, I can't think straight.
It's Ms.
Watson and Harlan Emple.
We're consultants with the department.
I'm sorry.
There've been people in and out all morning.
Of course.
Your son's case is very important to us.
It never was before.
But maybe that was for the best.
If I just let it lie, that police captain I talked to, he wouldn't have gotten hurt.
Actually, we wanted to talk to you about him.
We were wondering how he got onto the case.
Are you saying that you brought it to him?
Yeah.
A couple weeks back.
I read about a missing girl they found, the Major Case Squad.
I thought, that's who should've been looking for my Tim.
Those detectives at the beginning, I never really thought they were looking too hard.
They never listened to me.
They listened to my ex 'cause he's on the job.
And that would be Tim's father?
Yeah, Marty Bledsoe.
He's a sergeant with the 16th.
When Tim disappeared, Marty told everyone, "Oh, he's just run off.
" He sounded so sure, I even wanted to believe it, but then Tim's birthday rolls by, then my birthday, still no word from him.
It started to sink in.
Something awful must've happened.
And the detectives handling the disappearance didn't agree?
Tim's last years were pretty bad.
He got in fights.
He drank.
There might've been some dr*gs.
Most people would believe Tim was the kind of kid to drop off the map.
Anyone in his orbit stand out as capable of v*olence?
I don't know.
(scoffs)
All of them.
Tim mostly kept to himself, but the people he did hang around with were no good.
It's part of why Tim and Marty fought so much, part of why me and Marty fought, too.
You've mentioned your ex twice now.
You think he did this, don't you?
Captain Gregson wanted to tread lightly.
That's why he was looking into Tim's case himself.
But I've gone to bed every night for eight months thinking the same thing: Marty sure did a good job of keeping the police from looking too hard for our son.
This is some sick joke, calling me in like I'm some kind of criminal.
Your ex-wife asked my boss to take a look at your son's case, to take a look at you.
Now he's on life support at St.
Bede's.
Yeah.
You know, somewhere on my list of things that make today the worst day of my life is knowing that Elise thinks that somehow I could hurt our son.
Why would she think that?
I don't know.
She always blamed me for facing the truth.
She was too weak to do that.
And what's the truth?
That Tim was a bad seed.
And it broke my heart realizing that there was no reaching him, but there wasn't.
The file in his disappearance, it lists a few people Tim got mixed up with, some minor incidents at school.
I don't see anything here that makes him a bad seed.
Well, you can thank me for that.
I mean, it kind of helps having a police sergeant for a father.
I can't tell you how many times I had charges squashed: vandalism, public intoxication, grand theft auto.
Like I said, bad seed.
He was such a sweet, little boy.
But me and Elise, uh we lost him a long time ago.
What can you tell me about eight months ago?
You want to hear it?
Fine.
I loved that kid, right up until he made it impossible.
But even then, come on.
I would never hurt him.
I didn't.
And, I mean, if you need alibis, I got 'em.
More than one?
For Tim and your captain.
Week my boy went missing, I was fishing in Canada with a couple of buddies.
And last Thursday, time of the sh**ting, I was at home with my girlfriend.
You can ask her.
(sighs)
You should go home.
(sighs)
Listen, if you want I got a few names that probably aren't on that list.
Folks you ought to talk to.
Like I said, I cleaned up a lot of his messes.
Stanley Veek.
I'm a professor at Goldbriar C. C.
I had Tim Bledsoe in Introduction to Accounting Practices.
You can call me Patrick.
It's not Lieutenant Meers anymore.
I left the Army last year.
Well, I appreciate you coming in.
As I mentioned on the phone, Tim Bledsoe's body being found, it's given us reason to go back, talk to everyone he had trouble with, Mr.
Godel.
Jacob Godel.
And I don't mean to be adversarial, I'd just rather not help you.
Why is that?
Uh, because I don't care if Tim's k*ller is ever found.
What'd you have against him?
He slapped me in front of my whole class.
I was expecting, "No, Dr.
Veek, I don't know the difference between LIFO and FIFO," but instead he slapped me.
You know, I was drinking at a bar with a buddy and Tim was sitting a few stools down.
He overheard me say I was selling my car, so he asked if he could see it.
I took him outside to show it to him and he picked a fight with me.
He called me gay, sucker punched me, boom.
I'm a big guy.
He got it worse than I did.
The cops showed up, I told them to drop it.
Hell, I even went back in and finished my drink.
He was a demon, spawn of the Devil.
Maybe you could be more specific?
He beat me up.
I wanted to press charges, but his dad's a cop.
I reported the slap.
He was suspended.
End of story.
Yeah, I thought about revenge sometimes.
But I was on a trip to Argentina with my folks when he disappeared.
Hmm.
I felt bad for him.
He was troubled.
You know, you could just tell.
A head case.
One of those trench coat kids, you know?
Him and his friend.
His friend was the one I figured would end up in real trouble.
Nobody's mentioned Tim having any close friends.
Oh, he had one.
They hung out in the back of my class.
It was creepy as can be.
Dylan Halleran.
That's his name.
You moved your cot.
I needed somewhere to sit.
You want to talk?
Actually, at the moment, I've got very little to say about the m*rder of Tim Bledsoe.
Given his behavior, I think the only mystery is why he wasn't k*lled years ago.
I wasn't talking about the case, I was talking about the captain.
These last few days, everything happened so fast.
Marcus called, we packed our things, we came straight here.
We never even talked about it.
What's to talk about?
You and the captain, everything that happened before you left for London last year.
If memory serves, Watson, we talked about the subject ad nauseam before your own move to London.
I know, but it's different now.
How's it different?
Because someone tried to k*ll him?
He chose to protect his daughter over you.
That's not gonna change, no matter how many times he gets shot.
You came a very long way to help him.
It was the right thing to do.
You're risking a prison sentence.
Does that seem so out of character?
I got a call from Paige a little while ago.
He had a rough night.
If he doesn't show improvement soon Then what?
You should go see him.
Call it closure, call it whatever you want, but you should say what you want to say to him before it's too late.
He's unconscious.
It wouldn't be for him, it would be for you.
Well, you just said yourself, I'm wanted by the FBI.
I can't just pop into a hospital.
He could be in the basement of the Pentagon.
If you wanted to, you could find a way in and out of there, (phone ringing)
and no one would be the wiser.
Hey, Marcus, what's up?
We got a suspect.
Dylan Halleran.
I don't remember his name from the case file.
He wasn't in it.
Nobody on that list looked promising, but I like him; he was Tim's only friend.
And you think he k*lled him?
Let's just say he's capable.
I'm trying to unseal his juvenile records, but he's been pretty busy since he turned 16.
Three arrests.
One included a weapons charge.
He had his dad's .
380 on him when they popped him for possession of ketamine and stolen goods.
Surprised he isn't locked up.
He should be, but he skipped bail.
The judge issued a warrant for his arrest.
I just sent it to you.
This is great.
It will be if we find him.
Half the NYPD is beating the bushes.
Good.
I'll join them.
Bro, Th-this is not a phone.
Th-This is, like, an MP3 player.
This is trash, man.
What the hell?!
Wait, wait, come back.
Ow!
Dylan Halleran, we've been looking for you.
More like rousting ketamine dealers in areas that your record suggests you're likely to frequent.
What do you want?
The truth about what happened to Tim Bledsoe.
I haven't seen him in forever.
What, are you guys looking for him or something?
We know where he is.
He's in the morgue.
Shot to death with a .
380, just like yours.
Wait, what?
Tim's dead?
Has been for eight months.
I thought he just split or something, but he was dead.
You guys think I did it?
When's the last time you saw him?
About eight months ago.
I, I remember, 'cause it was right before he stole my car.
I know what you guys are thinking, okay.
That car theft is a motive for m*rder.
Yeah, it was a d*ck move, but I wouldn't k*ll him over it.
Were you questioned recently by a police captain by the name of Tom Gregson?
Who?
No.
He was shot Thursday night.
Same caliber g*n.
No, no, no, no, no, I would never-- Wait, did you say Thursday?
Thursday I was dead.
I OD'd on some bad K.
They said at the hospital my heart stopped for, like, a minute.
I kept the bracelet in case I ever needed to go back.
As for Tim, you know, I wanted him found as bad as anyone so I could kick his a*s.
After he was done with my car, he parked it next to a hydrant in the Bronx.
It took me forever to save up enough to get it out of impound.
I just got it back, like, last week.
So the car was left virtually undisturbed since he disappeared.
Yeah.
I think so.
Why?
Is it nearby?
Forgive me for saying this, Dylan, but you don't strike me as the sort of gentleman who summers in Connecticut; do you know anything about this?
What is it?
It's a ticket for the Bridgeport Ferry, dated 23rd of October, 2018.
That's around the same time that Tim disappeared.
The day after he was last seen.
That would allow him to stow his vehicle on board and then cross Long Island Sound to Port Jefferson.
Was it Tim's?
(alarm chirps)
It's definitely not mine.
Did he say anything about taking any trips?
Not to me.
Pungent smell.
I know, man, he punked me hard.
- What does that mean?
- I told you.
He dumped the car where he knew it'd get towed.
He also filled the trunk with, like, a million bags of fertilizer.
I got rid of it, but I'll never get rid of that smell.
I don't think your friend was punking you, Dylan.
WATSON: Are those blasting caps?
To be used in conjunction with the fertilizer, I imagine.
I think Tim Bledsoe was planning on sinking the Long Island Ferry, and a few hundred people with it.
BELL: The kid you found in the wall, he was plotting a terror attack?
Technically, it's just a theory.
But he had all the materials for a fertilizer b*mb in the trunk of a car he stole.
Going by the smell, I'm pretty sure the lab is gonna confirm it.
They're gonna find traces of solid ammonium nitrate fertilizer in the trunk.
Same stuff that was used in the Oklahoma City bombing.
He have enough to sink a ship?
According to Dylan, the trunk was full of it, at least 800 pounds.
That's enough to punch a hole in just about anything.
Well, the ferry makes sense if Tim was some kind of aspiring domestic t*rror1st.
Why else would he drive from Queens to Connecticut and then drive all the way back to Port Jefferson?
I called the ferry.
They're gonna check exact numbers on ridership, but best guess, the ship would have gone down with 200 people on board that day.
Instead, Tim Bledsoe gets shot and stuffed in a wall one day before all this is supposed to happen.
I can't imagine it's a coincidence, which only leads to more questions.
Was this Tim's plan?
Was he working for someone?
Did his accomplice get cold feet?
Crossed my mind, the guy who shot him did the world a pretty big favor.
But if we're talking about some hero who learned what Tim was up to, why not call the cops?
Why sh**t a cop to keep it all a secret?
I agree.
It doesn't make any sense.
Someone had to know Tim's plan.
I got to let the feds in on all this, see if he was on their radar.
I'm guessing you don't want to join me.
Actually, I want to talk to Tim's mother again.
She didn't think he was such a bad kid.
I want to know if she was lying to me or just herself.
You think Tim wanted to k*ll people?
We know it's hard to hear, but we don't have a better explanation for what we found so far.
Can you think of another reason he would have bought a ticket for the Bridgeport Ferry?
Do you have friends or relatives in Connecticut?
I have no idea why he would've wanted to drive up there, but what you're saying a-a b*mb?
It's not possible.
I would know.
Well, maybe some part of you did know subconsciously?
You trying to cover for him?
This is ridiculous.
My son was not a bomber.
HOLMES: Perhaps not.
We're by no means certain that he acted alone.
Plot like this requires considerable planning, sophistication, and technical expertise.
WATSON: You said that Tim fell in with the wrong crowd.
Can you think of anyone in particular who might have gotten in his ear?
Anyone who knew how to build a fertilizer b*mb?
You know something.
No, I don't, but but you said "fertilizer.
" That's right.
He had a lot of it.
Right before Tim went missing, about a week, maybe, I lost my credit card.
Or I thought I did.
I-I didn't want to believe it was Tim.
There were these weird charges.
I called and complained.
I told the company they were fraud, and they canceled them.
But it was Tim.
He bought a lot of other stuff, too.
But it could just be a coincidence, right?
I mean, it-it could've been fraud.
We need to see those charges.
HOLMES: The investigation into your sh**ting proceeds apace.
I'm confident we'll find the person responsible.
Also hello.
It's my understanding that, despite your condition, you might understand some, if not all, of what I'm saying.
Of course it's more likely I'm just talking to myself.
What you did to Watson You jeopardized everything.
Yeah.
I know Hannah's your daughter, so I would have understood.
I would have helped you.
And-and I want you to know that I forgive you.
Of course I do.
Should've got yourself shot a lot sooner, we could have settled this all then.
(light clattering)
How much of that did you hear?
I came in at "I forgive you.
" How did you get past the guy in the hall?
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come.
No, I'm glad you did.
I think he would be, too.
You know, I don't know what went down between you guys last year, I mean, not really, but I know that he missed you.
Every day.
He loves you.
I mean, he can't say it right now.
Hell, he probably couldn't say it even if he was awake but he does.
Did you get to say everything you wanted to?
932 bucks.
That's all it costs to build a car b*mb, huh?
If you're making it out of gardening supplies, but that's not why I wanted you to see that statement.
Check out the highlighted charges.
Looks like all the purchases Tim's mom flagged as fraud were at businesses in the Bronx.
See all the little ones from Natty G's?
So that is a diner attached to a youth hostel in Morris Heights.
So you know where Tim was staying before he died.
Better than that.
I have footage of Tim being abducted.
So it happened out front, the night before he was going to Connecticut to set sail.
Nobody ever saw this?
He was checked in under a fake name, so nobody knew to look.
But the building across the street has an exterior security camera that caught the whole thing.
Time-stamped 22:34.
BELL: Okay.
There's Tim.
Now there's just a second at the end, you get a glimpse of the guy, but you can see, plain as day, he's carrying a g*n.
There.
That's got to be enough for facial recognition.
Actually, we won't need it.
I met that bastard yesterday.
(children arguing)
PATRICK: Hon, I'm heading to the store.
We need anything besides detergent and lunch meat?
WIFE: No, I think that's it.
Tessa, let him be the squirrel this time.
WIFE: Pat, did you forget something?
All units, be advised, subject knows we're out here.
He heard us.
They're pretty sure.
He's got six registered g*ns and two kids inside.
All right, tell your men to stand down.
I got to talk to him.
Patrick Meers.
Come out with your hands up.
We don't want to see anyone in that house get hurt, Patrick.
All my weapons are on the floor by the door.
Please, my family's inside.
(grunting)
OFFICER: Don't move.
OFFICER 2: See if there's additional weapons.
I don't know if you need me to sign something, or if me just saying it's enough, but I did it.
BELL: Mr.
Meers, to be clear, you're confessing to k*lling Tim Bledsoe and Yeah.
Yeah, I'll tell you everything.
You deserve that at least.
I didn't really want to sh**t that cop, the captain.
I didn't want to, but he figured it out.
Let's start at the beginning.
You told me yesterday Tim Bledsoe was just a stranger who sucker punched you.
Now we'll get into why in a minute, but I'm having a hard time believing that's all there was to it.
It was stupid.
Okay?
I should've let it drop.
But it just didn't sit right.
You know, this punk jumped me and he was gonna skate?
You don't expect us to believe this was all over a bar fight?
I thought the cops were gonna charge him with as*ault, but his dad got him off.
It wasn't right.
I guess I wanted revenge, you could call it.
BELL: So this kid, who you didn't know until he picked a fight with you at a bar, how'd you find him?
The people at the bar, when I went back, they knew where he was staying.
I had my g*n, so I caught him when he left his place.
Got him into the car to have a chat.
I don't even know what we were gonna talk about, but we didn't get that far.
He tried to grab my g*n.
So you sh**t him.
Now you've got a body to get rid of.
You take him to the baseball field.
I'm an electrician.
I got a partner, Scott Darnell.
He didn't have anything to do with this, but he's how I knew about the field.
He umps games up there in Queens and his brother's the commissioner or whatever.
He was helping 'em finish the snack bar.
I got it from the league that field was built by Hansen Construction.
They just poured the foundation.
Walked off the job.
Scotty was finishing it pro Bono.
We got a picture of the ribbon-cutting in our office.
That's why we're here now.
That's when the captain came to see you.
Yeah, he saw the photo and the date on it, same week Tim went missing.
He said he was going back over the case, talking to everybody in the file.
He didn't push it, but I could tell he saw how nervous I was.
So when he left, I followed him.
My stomach dropped when he started going towards the field.
He was gonna find Tim.
I-I had to stop him.
Tried to, at least.
He fired back.
That's how he got to his car.
By the time I got to mine, he was gone.
That's the whole story.
For what it's worth, - I'm-I'm really sorry.
- You're lying.
What?
There's a couple of key ingredients missing from your story.
Uh I don't know what you mean.
Yeah, you do.
Tim Bledsoe was gonna blow up the Bridgeport Ferry the day after you shot him.
What?
Come clean, man.
How were you involved?
I'm sorry, I-I don't know what you're talking about.
He was really gonna blow up a ferry?
You knew he was.
No.
You're wrong, okay?
This is the first I'm hearing about it.
So what now?
Do I get a lawyer?
He's lying.
He is, at the very least, suppressing a larger truth.
I've been digging into Mr.
Meers.
He is, from all outward appearances, a Boy Scout.
Served two tours in Afghanistan before an honorable discharge.
He has two young children and an accountant wife with the world's most banal social media presence.
Never so much as an overdue library book, and the only mention of him in the news is an article in which he chased down a purse snatcher who robbed an imam's wife outside a mosque in Brooklyn.
In other words, not the bio of a guy who decides to m*rder someone over a month-old bar fight.
You said the case is all but closed?
It's what the department wants.
He never wavered from his story, and there's no way to prove that he knew about Tim Bledsoe's plan to blow up the ferry, but he did.
It was written all over his face.
Perhaps the two of them got talking that night in the bar.
Tim got so drunk, he tipped his hand, Patrick decided to play hero.
A month later?
And without saying a word to the police?
Hmm.
Perhaps Tim Bledsoe is not the lone wolf that we thought he was.
He's part of a terror cell, along with Meers.
The group had doubts about Tim's plan or his loyalty, and Meers was sent to dispatch him.
Well, Tim's mental health obviously wasn't great.
He could've been radicalized.
And Patrick wouldn't be the first vet to come back from Afghanistan with a new and toxic ideology.
If you're right, there could be plans for more att*cks in New York.
I'll call Marcus in the morning, let him know this is something he should look into.
In the meantime, I'm gonna pack.
You should do the same.
The car's coming to pick us up tomorrow at 6:00.
Hide all the keys and seal our windows 'Cause I'm going to w*r - HOLMES: Don't pack.
- What?
Don't pack.
Stay.
The department might be through with Meers, but you and Marcus don't have to be.
It could be good for you.
You said in London - that you missed it here.
- Yeah, but Stay.
Make sure there's no more danger, no active terror cell.
What about you?
I could stay, too.
No.
No, there's no way.
There's no way I'm gonna stay here with you and worry the whole time that you're gonna get arrested.
Then I'll go.
You can do what you've been pretending to do the last few days: keep me apprised in London, and I'll help you from there.
Are you sure?
No but what choice do we have?
Don't hold your breath waiting for me 'Cause I may never come home Leave all your bags and head for the water Chase the lies into the sea Don't hold your breath waiting for me 'Cause I may never come home No, I may never come home 'Cause I may never come home No, I may never come home Don't hold your breath Waiting for me 'Cause I may never come home No, I may never come home WOMAN: Next.
OFFICER: Sir.
What are you doing?
I'm here to surrender myself.
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
I'm wanted for the m*rder of Michael Rowan.
Waiting for me 'Cause I won't ever come home.
