WATSON: Previously on Elementary That's the same thing that happened to our phones and computers right before Odin showed up.
GREGSON: We're talking about a billionaire who's illegally spying on people and then having them k*lled.
You got nothing.
Is the entire NSA in Odin's pocket, or is it just you?
We have to plan a m*rder of our own.
(g*n cocks)
That's what this is.
ODIN: I was lured to the bridge under false pretenses.
No!
I was confronted by a madman.
I managed to pry his g*n away from him, and I used it to defend myself.
You k*lled Sherlock to keep him from talking, from telling the world what you are.
The big news at the top of the hour: Sentencing today in the trial of Odin Reichenbach.
The former Odker CEO was found guilty last week on dozens of criminal charges stemming from his role in a murderous conspiracy against his own customers.
And today, Judge Omar Cortez handing down a total of 148 years in prison for those crimes.
My next guest should be familiar to anyone who's been following this story.
She and her late partner brought Reichenbach's crimes to light three years ago.
Joan Watson.
And good morning, Joan.
Good morning.
Thank you for having me.
You've been waiting a long time for this.
Yes.
Three years.
But it was worth the wait.
Odin Reichenbach is finally getting what he deserves.
Well, he got what amounts to a life sentence, but there is one m*rder that he was not charged with, and that's the m*rder of your partner, Sherlock Holmes.
It was frustrating when the D. A. 's office decided to drop those charges, but it was a strategic move on their part, and today, it looks like it paid off.
If Sherlock were still here, I think he would be pleased with the outcome.
Well, I've really enjoyed reading about him in your book.
It's The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes.
This is an incredible tribute to your partner.
Thank you.
You must miss him very much.
Every day.
What did you think?
BELL: I think you crushed it, but that's not why I'm calling.
Something's up?
He's back.
You're kidding.
I'm looking right at him.
All right.
I'll be right there.
Hey.
Where is he?
Arthur.
- (gasps)
Mommy!
Hi!
ROSE: Sorry.
He was begging to come here all morning.
He loves this place.
Like mother, like son.
Honey, can you do me a favor?
Can you help Rose get our things together, and then we can go home and have lunch?
Yeah?
Great.
Thank you.
You really did do great this morning.
Oh, thanks.
So, how's it going with the, uh The Smith homicide?
You were right.
The uncle was the one who sent him that ivory box.
When we searched his office, we found what was left of the poison he put on the tip of that spring.
WATSON: Did he confess?
Sang like a bird.
Honestly, I'm more interested in how the Tellavecchio case is going.
Everything on track?
Yes.
Everything's on track.
Bye, Captain Bell.
Arthur.
Buddy.
We've been through this.
I prefer Uncle Marcus.
Bye, Uncle Marcus.
(Arthur laughing)
ARTHUR: Rose, come see.
Mommy found Do you have any idea how hard you're trending right now?
(sighs)
About 100% more than I'd like to be?
I'm just saying.
Your publisher better be ready to roll out a new edition of your book.
I did not do the interview to sell books.
Tell her that she needs a publicist.
You need a publicist.
What I need, Sean, is an assistant who means it when he says he's gonna cut back on the energy drinks.
Your contractor called about 20 minutes ago.
He said to give you this estimate for the renovations you were considering for the media room.
Oh.
Maybe I should try to sell more books.
Want me to get him on the line for you?
No.
You know what, I'm beat.
I just want to change into some comfortable clothes and play with Arthur.
You know what?
You can call it a day, too.
You sure?
Hmm.
Positive.
Oh, my God.
I almost forgot.
There's someone waiting for you downstairs, an attorney.
He got here just a few minutes before you did.
You know what, just find out who he's representing and what they've been accused of, and I'll get back to him.
Actually, he said very specifically that he wasn't looking to hire a detective.
He said he wanted to talk to you about a mutual friend.
Someone named Jamie Moriarty?
RONALD: "The descent to the infernal regions is easy enough, "but to retrace one's steps, and reach the air above, there's the rub. " Virgil.
It's nice to meet you, Virgil.
I'm Joan Watson.
Actually, um You were quoting Virgil.
Yes, I know.
It's dark down here, but no one's ever called it "infernal. " My apologies.
I'm Ronald Adair.
My assistant said that you are friends with Jamie Moriarty.
I promise, you're in no danger from me.
What about from her?
Actually, no one's in danger from her.
Not anymore.
Jamie Moriarty is dead.
What?
Suffice it to say, it was work-related.
I would offer my condolences, but she was a terrible person.
(scoffs)
She always spoke so highly of you.
I'm here because I'm the executor of her will.
She left strict instructions that this be brought to Sherlock Holmes upon her demise.
Sherlock died three years ago.
I am aware.
Just as I am aware that he named you his sole heir.
He wanted you to have everything.
So I think that makes this yours, don't you?
I don't want it.
Miss Watson Jamie Moriarty was crazy.
It could be a b*mb, for all I know.
No.
I don't think so.
You'll recall that she had certain rules when it came to you and Mr.
Holmes.
She would never have tried to k*ll you when she was alive.
I find it hard to imagine that she would try now that she is dead.
ROSE: Big man's all ready for bed.
You want me to put him down before I go, or did you want to do it?
No, I'll do it, thanks.
You okay?
You seem a little off today.
Yeah, it's probably because I am a little off today.
Odin was sentenced, I had to do that interview.
I-I just, I guess I haven't had to think about Sherlock this much in a long time.
And someone left that for him today.
ROSE: You're kidding.
Are you gonna open it?
I wouldn't feel right.
It's from someone who cared about him.
Can you send it back?
No.
She died, too.
Well, if they cared about each other, at least they're together now, right?
Rose, you know what?
I changed my mind.
Could you stay another hour?
There's something I need to do.
(TV playing indistinctly nearby)
(loud, overlapping voices)
You still playing this game?
It's not a game.
"It's an exercise," I remember.
Got your message.
So who's trying to k*ll you?
And how can I help?
Elementary 7x13 Their Last Bow Ã‚  Yesterday, you were visited by a man who claimed to be Moriarty's attorney.
He said that she had died and left this package to me.
You then went to my grave and demolished my headstone.
I know you said I should only do that in case of emergency Ah, my specific instructions were you should only do it if your life was in danger.
It was Moriarty, okay?
You loved her.
I Look, whatever it is, I thought you should have it.
I'm assuming you heard about Odin?
Our plan worked.
It was my plan.
I said we should orchestrate a m*rder, my m*rder.
I predicted that in the course of the investigation that followed, Odin's many other crimes would come to light, and I was right.
Which isn't to say that you didn't play your part.
If you hadn't gone to the crime scene before CSU to replace the shell casings of the b*ll*ts that he fired, the police would've realized they were blanks.
And you should also be commended for the job you did planting my blood.
You said that you were gonna find a way to contact me once a month.
That lasted for what, a year?
Give or take.
I have been worried about you for the last two years, thinking that you had died for real!
Hey.
I am talking to you.
Look, I'm sorry if I gave you cause for concern, but I assure you my falling out of touch was absolutely necessary.
I kept quite busy after my death.
Traveled.
First to Florence, and then to Tibet.
Spent a goodly amount of time in Norway.
You may have read of the remarkable exploits of a Norwegian named Sigerson.
I suppose it never occurred to you, you were receiving news of your friend.
What the hell are you talking about?
Being dead hasn't kept me from being a detective.
In fact, it's been quite a boon.
Over the last three years, I've assumed various identities in various countries, using each of them to strike at powerful criminals from the shadows-- including our old friend, Moriarty.
Are you saying that you're the reason she's dead?
She isn't dead.
You were tricked.
What?
After my father's death, she did exactly what you and I had long predicted she would do.
She took over her group again?
Over the years, using various aliases, I managed to sabotage her efforts.
Obviously, she began to suspect I was still alive.
She sent one of her lieutenants here to attempt to goad you into bringing me to New York.
And he succeeded.
Only natural you'd grow a bit rusty in my absence.
How can you be sure she isn't really dead?
You think I wouldn't know?
I have no idea what you would know.
I haven't heard from you in two years.
If I'm right, one of her henchmen would have been watching this place, awaiting my return.
It's possible it's not too late to stop him from contacting her.
I see you've made some changes.
Do we still have the secret exit to the street?
This place has a secret exit?
ARTHUR: Mommy, who are you talking to?
Uh, sweetie, just one second.
(siren chirping)
I didn't pull you away from anything, did I?
No.
Arthur's in nursery school.
So, you said someone got shot out here?
Execution style.
Body's on the riverbank.
According to his I. D.
and the business cards we found in his wallet, he's an attorney named Ronald Adair.
You okay?
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.
Hey.
HOLMES: Act naturally.
Don't tell Marcus you know the victim.
You still think Moriarty is dead?
No, I don't.
I retraced Adair's steps after he left you last night.
A car service dropped him off a block away.
If you're attempting to locate me, please stop.
Best we keep this between us.
You sure about that?
Positive.
I'll meet you back at the brownstone.
You kept the bees.
I thought Arthur might find them interesting.
Plus, the free honey.
He's remarkable, your son.
As I was coming up the street, he and his nanny walked right by me.
She's ex-military, no?
Three tours in Afghanistan.
Anyone I helped put in prison tries to get at me through him She puts them to bed with no supper.
Something like that.
You're still a blonde.
You just noticed?
How'd you get the?
Oh, uh difference of opinion with a compromised member of the Guardia Svizzera.
He thought the Pope should be kidnapped.
I didn't.
Look, I'm sorry about earlier, rushing through everything.
Three years on my own, my manners aren't what they used to be.
I do owe you an explanation for breaking off contact the way that I did.
Perhaps I could give it over tea?
The early days of my exile were difficult.
I didn't just give up my friends when I left New York, I gave up my career as well.
I tried to focus on my health, on my sobriety, but it-it wasn't enough.
I needed an outlet.
I needed to work.
So I did.
You said you started taking on new identities.
In Florence, I was Altamont.
In Norway, I was Sigerson.
With each new city came a new name, and with each new name, a new profession.
A new profession?
Work as a consulting detective, I'm sure you'll agree, was impossible.
There was too much risk I would be recognized by an old ally, or worse, an old enemy, so I crafted aliases which would allow me to get close to criminals without arousing suspicion.
In France, for example, I posed as a researcher of coal tar derivatives.
Within a few months, I was able to demonstrate to the French government-- anonymously, of course-- that the French energy giant Puissance GÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale was involved in illegal coal mining in Morocco and responsible for the deaths of dozens of miners.
That was you?
Mm-hmm.
Just one of my adventures.
But with my adventures came powerful enemies.
Corporations and criminal organizations who would stop at nothing to find me.
Communication with you, therefore, became even more dangerous.
In the event I was exposed, I didn't want anyone to think that you were party to my endeavors.
You could've said all this in your last message to me two years ago.
I couldn't risk you trying to help me.
Not after your last message.
Arthur.
I told you about him.
Your adoption had just been approved.
That changed everything for both of us.
If anything had happened to him because of me I confess, I didn't appreciate the extent to which my silence affected you until you published your book.
The book was a tribute to you.
It was revenge.
You knew that I would hate having so much known about me.
Fine, it was revenge.
You seem good.
Happy.
Dare say I am.
The work I've been doing has been some of the most rewarding of my career.
And I need look no further than your refrigerator to see that you're happy as well.
Yes, my death three years ago was born out of desperation.
But, as it turns out it could be the best thing that's happened to either of us.
Moriarty.
If she knows you're alive, does that mean we're in danger?
She never wanted us dead before, but we've changed over the last three years.
It's possible she has as well.
Ronald Adair had to have been our best shot at figuring out what her next move was, right?
If he wasn't, why would she have had him k*lled?
I've known his name for some time.
He is a part of her inner circle.
But I think a deep dive is in order.
We should break into his home, have a look around.
We don't need to break in.
We can just call Marcus.
The man thinks I'm dead.
Hmm.
Well, about that I can't believe you told him what we did.
He thought you were really dead, okay?
He took it hard; so did the captain.
After a few weeks, I just couldn't lie to them anymore.
You told the captain as well?
They could've exposed us.
Odin Reichenbach could've gone free.
Okay.
Were they happy about what we did?
No.
But Odin had threatened their families.
They knew he had to go.
It's good to see you, Marcus.
(grunts)
I'm doing this for you.
Not him.
(groans)
So, did you also punch Watson when she told you I was alive?
BELL: Captain Gregson and I were pretty ticked when she explained, but at least she was here.
At least she acknowledged what you two put us through.
Well, it's good to see you've thrived, Marcus.
Becoming captain, not to mention a husband and father.
When did Captain Gregson retire?
WATSON: About a year ago.
He wanted to spend as much time as possible with Paige while he still could.
She passed?
BELL: Yeah, and in case you're wondering, she's actually gone, not off fighting super-crime in Europe or anything.
I didn't know.
BELL: Funny how much you don't hear about when you let your friends think you're dead.
WATSON: I think I found something.
So, coming to see me was not the only interesting thing that Adair did yesterday.
According to this, he received a wire transfer of $200,000 from an account in Dubai.
And then an hour later, he wired the same amount to someone named HernÃƒÂ¡n Zielenko.
Like he was sending the money along as an intermediary.
Could be it was just another errand for Moriarty.
I'm familiar with the bank.
They specialize in client privacy.
Extracting the source of the money could take days.
Then we start with the recipient.
Zielenko.
Ron Adair is dead, huh?
Man, I just talked to him yesterday.
Actually, we know.
That's why we're here.
What, you think I had something to do with it?
Right now, we're just interested in the 200 grand Adair sent you from an account in Dubai.
We did our homework before coming here, Mr.
Zielenko.
Far as we can tell, you keep your nose clean, but some of the names on your payroll jumped out.
They're the kind of names that tend to get no-show jobs at construction sites from friends.
He's saying he reckons your mates are involved in organized crime.
Yeah, your friends said they work for the police, but I didn't catch your name.
Gareth Lestrade.
I'm on loan from Scotland Yard.
We just want to know what the transfer was about.
Maybe you were a go-between, same as Adair, and one of your friends is the one doing business with the person we're interested in.
Look, hand to God, Adair was just paying me back what he lost at cards.
See, we play poker in the same card room.
The weekend before last, we got into it, heads-up.
Lasted for hours.
Adair didn't know when to quit.
He just kept losing.
By the end of the night, he was in to me for the 200K.
And that's the hand that finally ended it.
BELL: You mind telling us where the card room is, so we can confirm all that?
Yeah.
That, I can't do.
See, these friends of mine-- the ones that you mentioned-- it's their operation.
I'm not gonna be the guy who brings the cops there.
Now, you want to arrest me for that, fine.
I'll call my lawyer right now.
Marcus is gonna keep looking into Adair.
If he was as degenerate a gambler as Zielenko says, other people in his life are bound to know.
In the meantime, I thought we could apply pressure to that bank in Dubai.
Well, you're welcome to try, but I'm not ready to move off Zielenko just yet.
I think he knows more than he's letting on.
I don't necessarily disagree, but how do you plan to prove it?
With these.
Hey, Rose is coming back with Arthur soon.
Oh, this won't take long.
Uh, can I help you find something?
While we were at Zielenko's office, I noticed that these cards are made of plastic, not paper.
Yeah, lots of players use them.
They last longer.
True, but it opened up a possibility.
Acetone?
What do you need that for?
To melt the cards.
WATSON: How is melting a playing card gonna help us figure out what Moriarty is up to?
It isn't.
I no longer think she's behind this.
What?
Someone else lured me out of hiding and had Adair claim it was on Moriarty's behalf.
Look at that card.
It's an RFID chip.
In the same way these can be used in a key card to identify employees, they can also be used in playing cards to identify a card's suit and rank.
So Zielenko was using them to cheat.
That's how he won all that money from Adair.
It was a setup.
Someone, some third party, wanted Adair in debt to Zielenko.
Why?
Because they intended to settle his debt for him.
All he had to do Was come here the other night and tell me Moriarty was dead.
That's why you think Moriarty isn't behind this.
If she wanted Adair to lie to me, she could've just ordered him to do it.
Using these cards requires a special table, with a special sensor at every seat.
Then the card room must've been in on it.
Zielenko basically said it was run by a mob family.
The Delluccis.
The thing is, I've never crossed paths with any of them.
We have, as they say, "no beef. " So it's hard to imagine they're the ones looking for me.
So if it wasn't them?
It was someone with the skills required to infiltrate a mob card room and plant equipment without being detected.
What are you doing?
These cards have a very distinctive pattern.
One of my aliases has a contact in New York that might be able to help us identify the card room where they came from.
What's the Tellavecchio case?
Hmm?
The Tellavecchio case.
I heard Marcus ask you about it outside the warehouse.
It sounded quite serious.
I mean, while I'm here, perhaps I could, you know It's handled.
Thank you.
There is another way that we could identify the people we're looking for.
But you'd have to pursue it alone.
What is it?
Well, if I'm right and Moriarty did not send Adair here, whoever did, obviously has awareness of her group.
So?
So, perhaps her group has a corresponding awareness of them.
(indistinct chatter)
WATSON: Ellory?
Miss Watson.
I was surprised to get your message.
When I went to the cafÃƒÂ© where you met Sherlock four years ago, they said you hadn't worked there in a long time.
They claimed they had no idea how to reach you.
The first part's true.
In other words, you've moved up in Moriarty's organization?
I'm here to see the performance-- Well, to keep an eye on someone who's here to see the performance.
So what is it you want to ask me?
A lawyer named Ronald Adair came to see me yesterday.
He told me that Moriarty was dead.
The thing is, I don't think that's true.
I think someone made him say that.
So my question to you is: who would want me to think that Moriarty had died?
That's funny.
You want information, but so far, you're the one filling in the blanks for me.
One of my jobs is to track our people's movements in New York.
When I realized Adair had gone to your home yesterday, I confronted him.
Asked him why.
He said I had it all wrong.
He hadn't been anywhere near your place.
You're the one that k*lled him.
Thank you for confirming for me he'd been compromised.
Let me ask you a question.
Why do you suppose someone would want you to think my boss was dead?
I have no idea.
(chuckles)
Maybe-- just maybe, they think your partner is alive, too.
They thought you would try to send him a message.
That's crazy.
Joan.
It's okay.
We've known he's alive for months.
He did a little work for the Vatican last year.
Ended up with a scar right here.
Word got back to us.
Say you're right, Sherlock is alive.
If Moriarty knew that Why did she let him keep interfering with her operations?
Because he was hurting her enemies even more, net gain for her.
Plus you know how she is about him.
(lobby bell chimes)
It's been a pleasure finally meeting you.
If you do find out who sent Adair, will you let me know?
We'd love to have a chat with them.
Either way, my boss, your partner the game goes on.
We'll see each other around.
(phone ringing)
Watson.
Looks like you were half right.
That's half unlikely.
WATSON: Moriarty is alive, but she did not send Adair.
So what did I get wrong?
The people who sent Adair did not k*ll him.
Her people k*lled him because she didn't send him.
And using her name in vain is a capital offense.
As far as who he was working for, their guess is as good as ours.
Well, if we're lucky, we won't have to guess.
My contact was able to help me find the card room where Zielenko swindled Adair.
Is it in a submarine?
Because your reception is terrible.
No.
I'm not underwater, I'm underground.
I found the technology used to cheat Adair.
If we're able to trace it (static)
Watson?
Watson?
(door opening)
You.
Me.
Got to say, you're looking pretty spry for a dead man.
Ã‚  When my phone went blue, half expected Odin Reichenbach to appear.
You thought that was his technology?
Please.
We gave that to him.
So, watching his trial these last three years, I kept waiting for your name to come up.
It never did.
How did you manage that?
Let's just say he understood it was in his best interest to keep my name and the NSA out of it.
Lest he be brutally m*rder*d in a federal prison?
I understand congratulations are in order.
Not only did you manage to sidestep the scandal, but you got a promotion.
What exactly does the NSA's director of foreign affairs do?
Well, it's hard to explain.
Spy on everyone, everywhere, all of the time?
Maybe it's not that hard to explain.
I mean, the truth is, without this new gig, I probably wouldn't have figured out you were still alive.
The work you did in Florence?
Tibet?
Norway?
All those bad guys practically gift wrapped for law enforcement.
Nobody stepping up to take credit?
I mean, I couldn't be sure it was you, but I figured, why not take a flier?
You compromised Adair.
You lured me back to New York.
Look, for all intents and purposes, I'm dead.
Why go to all the trouble of unearthing me just to make it official?
(laughs)
You think I'm here to k*ll you?
I-I lured you back here because I think the work you've been doing is top-shelf.
I wanted to know if you'd be willing to do it on assignment.
Me?
An operative of the U. S.
government?
A-Answering to you?
I wouldn't ask you to change a thing.
(laughs)
The work I've been doing has been entirely on foreign soil.
I've been solving problems for other countries, not the U.
S.
Come on, Holmes.
I mean, we may not be as pretty as we used to be, but we're still the straw that stirs the drink.
Other countries' problems become our problems.
Their bad guys become our bad guys.
You've been doing us favor after favor.
I just-- I-I want to make it official.
I want you to have the tools that you need.
The NSA's full suite of surveillance capabilities?
Everything we can do.
Everything we already know.
You think you're having fun now?
What's the catch?
There has to be a catch?
You've been a ghost for the last three years.
I'm asking you to be one for the rest of your life.
This woman, Ellory, she confessed, but you don't think we can do anything about it?
Knowing Moriarty, Ellory could be in another country by now.
Well, if Sherlock's psycho ex-girlfriend didn't trick him into coming back to New York, who did?
He's working on it.
He called me last night, but his signal was terrible; we got cut off.
He never called you back?
Yeah, well, you know how good he is at staying in touch.
Must be weird for you, having him back.
Weird is an understatement.
You're not mad at him?
I'm getting over it.
I mean, he seems happy.
The work he's doing, it suits him.
It's not the kind of work that he and I could've done together, even before Arthur.
You gonna tell him?
Like I said, he seems happy.
I'm not gonna tell him anything.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
I'm terribly sorry.
I thought he'd be at school.
WATSON: It's okay.
Arthur, this is an old friend of Mommy's.
Hi.
Truly an honor.
WATSON: Um, listen, honey, why don't you go put your gi on, and then we're gonna go to class, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Go on.
Martial arts?
I just thought it's never too early, right?
I was worried about you.
Sorry.
Busy night.
I found the person who was looking for me.
McNally.
There's a name I never thought I'd hear again.
That makes two of us.
So, the good news is that no one wants to k*ll you.
The bad news is, the NSA knows you're out there.
You should know they're not the only ones.
According to Ellory, Moriarty's known for months.
Nah.
Bollocks.
She knew about your scar.
How you got it.
When you got it.
So now two dangerous groups know that you're alive.
Look, if you're thinking about asking me to help you fake your death again, you can forget it.
Actually, I was thinking of taking McNally up on his offer.
What?
It would allow me to poke around inside the agency.
See what they're up to these days, and if I didn't like what I saw, they could be the next criminal group that I unravel.
Additionally, if Moriarty is aware of me She is.
I could pit the two groups against each other.
Only you would be happy about something like this.
I'm not happy.
I could be k*lled.
I'm pretty sure you're gonna live forever.
I'll be leaving tomorrow.
When you summoned me, I was in the middle of some sensitive work in Reykjavik.
I-I need to finish it.
What about McNally?
Oh, I don't know.
If I play hard to get Who knows?
Perhaps he'll sweeten the pot.
Reached out to Captain Gregson.
I said I'd like to see him and pay my respects.
After, perhaps you and Arthur and I could get some dinner?
It might be a while before we see each other again.
Dinner sounds great.
Nice one, kiddo.
When you asked me to meet you here, I assumed you'd be the one doing the golfing.
Because, naturally, I'd become a clichÃƒÂ© after I retired.
It's Paige's granddaughter.
She's gonna be the next Annika SÃƒrenstam.
The pro here owes me a few favors.
Long as I come with, he lets her hit b*lls for free.
So, Marcus struck me yesterday, if you'd like to do the same.
It's good to see you, man.
I thought the world of Paige.
I'm sorry I wasn't here.
It's okay.
I understood.
So, you're back now, right?
You're gonna stay in New York?
You said a few people had figured out you were still alive.
The jig is up.
No, I have to take my chances.
The work I've been doing is too important.
We don't have important work here?
I've made too many enemies.
You didn't have enemies before?
Watson didn't have a son before.
No.
She didn't.
But that's not the real reason you don't want to stay.
I'll never read people the way you do, but come on.
We've known each other a long time.
So what's the real reason I don't want to stay?
I don't know.
I just know that there's exactly one person that you really love in this world, and she's here.
You know, I told her the other day the early days of my exile were hard.
And what I didn't tell her was that I relapsed.
I came to in a hospital, and they told me I nearly died.
Quite coincidentally, around the same time, I received a communiquÃƒÂ© from Watson telling me that the adoption of her son was imminent.
Prior to that, I had been considering a return to New York.
A return to everything, really.
But the thought of her little boy finding me dead with a needle in my arm No, I can't go back.
Paige didn't want to be with me in the beginning.
She'd just been diagnosed.
She didn't want me to have to go through everything that was coming.
You know what I did?
I married her.
Best decision I ever made.
The years we had together I wouldn't trade them for anything.
But you're saying that Paige thought she represented a threat to your happiness, and I represent a threat to Watson's happiness, but your analogy is flawed.
'Cause Paige was offering you a choice.
I won't do that for Watson.
I can't.
You're right.
I want you to understand that when you love someone big enough, you can let them choose to be with you.
But that's not the only reason I'm comparing your situation to mine and Paige's.
There's something you need to know about Joan.
WATSON: Hey, I was gonna call you.
I assumed you wouldn't want to go out for dinner, being that you're a famous dead guy and all that, but I have to say, the delivery options have really fallen off the last few years, so I What is it?
The Tellavecchio case.
I know what it is.
I told him not to tell you.
Why?
Because I didn't want you to feel like you had to stay.
The, uh captain said that you had a lump removed a month ago, and Tellavecchio is the name of your oncologist.
Look, I only told a few people.
I didn't want anyone at the 11th to worry about me.
Yeah.
So, the pathology report was, um positive for cancer.
I'm starting chemo in a few days.
(sniffles)
You really would've let me leave without telling me.
Well, you you say that like I'm not planning to make it through this.
I am gonna see you again, Sherlock.
I'm just No.
Sherlock, I mean it.
I'm staying.
Sherlock I'm staying.
Of course I'm staying.
Holmes.
Just want to offer my condolences.
She was one of a kind.
You thought about what you want to do now that she's gone?
Some.
I mean, you've been out of commission almost a year.
Watson needed my help.
Yeah, but that's over now.
You know what I mean.
I need to be going.
I'd say it was good to see you, but it wasn't.
Holmes.
Do you regret it at all?
Not taking me up on my offer?
Not for a second.
WATSON: So, how was it?
It was interesting.
Interesting?
That's it?
You were expecting more?
Yes, I was expecting more.
It was Jamie Moriarty's funeral, for God's sake.
I told you, she's not dead.
Right, and of course you would know.
She's obviously taken a page out of our book.
She wants law enforcement to think she's dead so she can carry out some agenda.
Is that why you spent almost $500 on a floral arrangement?
Do we still own a shovel?
- Why?
- Why do you think?
You are not digging up her grave.
You're the one who seems to want proof she's alive.
Are you gonna tell me what you think of this wig or not?
It's very natural-looking.
I doubt your hair will play into Marcus's decision.
Did you bring the e-mail from Dr.
Tellavecchio?
I don't think I need a literal clean bill of health from the doctor to get my job back.
It's all right.
I've got a copy in my inbox.
I'll highlight the part that says "cancer-free. " I still think we should've called him first, give him a heads-up that we want to consult again.
I think he'll appreciate the surprise.
Or he'll punch me.
Either way.
(elevator bell chimes)
So, Tuesdays might be a problem.
I don't have Rose on Tuesdays, and Arthur's only in school until We'll work it out.
- What if he says no?
- He won't say no.
But what if he does?
Well As long as we're together, what does it matter?
(knocking on door)
