We passed the pretty cottage where the murdered man had lived, and walked up an oak-lined avenue to the fine old Queen Anne house, which bears the date of Malplaquet upon the lintel of the door. Holmes and the Inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate, which is separated by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road. A constable was standing at the kitchen door. ""Throw the door open, officer,"" said Holmes. ""Now, it was on those stairs that young Mr. Cunningham stood and saw the two men struggling just where we are. Old Mr. Cunningham was at that window--the second on the left--and he saw the fellow get away just to the left of that bush. Then Mr. Alec ran out and knelt beside the wounded man.

Knowing how genuine was her regard for him, I listened earnestly to her story when she came to my rooms in the second year of my married life and told me of the sad condition to which my poor friend was reduced. ""He\'s dying, Dr. Watson,"" said she. ""For three days he has been sinking, and I doubt if he will last the day. He would not let me get a doctor. This morning when I saw his bones sticking out of his face and his great bright eyes looking at me I could stand no more of it. \'With your leave or without it, Mr. Holmes, I am going for a doctor this very hour,\' said I. \'Let it be Watson, then,\' said he. I wouldn\'t waste an hour in coming to him, sir, or you may not see him alive."" I was horrified for I had heard nothing of his illness. I need not say that I rushed for my coat and my hat.

I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife\'s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me.

There was something of Mr. Pickwick\'s benevolence in his appearance, marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and by the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes. His voice was as smooth and suave as his countenance, as he advanced with a plump little hand extended, murmuring his regret for having missed us at his first visit. Holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him with a face of granite. Milverton\'s smile broadened, he shrugged his shoulders removed his overcoat, folded it with great deliberation over the back of a chair, and then took a seat.

That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way. ""So much for the servants.

Then of course I saw exactly what it all meant. My wife had gone over there, and had asked the servant to call her if I should return. Tingling with anger, I rushed down and hurried across, determined to end the matter once and forever. I saw my wife and the maid hurrying back along the lane, but I did not stop to speak with them.

A few days ago, we thought that you k*lled Felix Soto and Cyril Nauer in the hopes of solving P versus NP yourself someday. Now we know you k*lled them because you'd already solved it. You teamed up with a computer programmer, who could write the code required to steal several hundred million dollars from various financial institutions. WATSON: Problem was, he needed time to write the appropriate code for each one"", "". They offer a million dollars to anyone who can solve just one of the seven hardest problems in the world. And P versus NP is one of the seven. We know that the dead man, Soto, was working with a partner. And you said that Soto's neighbor heard him arguing with another man a few nights ago. Perhaps the partner thought he could complete the problem himself. Take the prize money without having to share it. For what it's worth, your victim would not have been working with just any mathematician"", "". In simplest terms, P versus NP asks if every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. Sounds innocent enough, right? Only it's not. It is filthy. Some experts have even theorized that it can't be solved. Could it be a motive for m*rder? That depends. You think a million dollars could be a motive for m*rder? I'm sorry. You're saying this is worth a million dollars? No, but it is getting there""]"

Are you saying we were played? In so many words. The $500 million that would have gone to Piazzi, is it going to be allocated to a different project? No, no, the money doesn't go anywhere, it just doesn't get allocated. But I think you're missing the bigger picture. That paper hurt all asteroid- hunting projects equally. Obviously, there are competing projects that would have loved to cut ahead, but they all rely on the same principles that Cole's paper att*cked"", "". Huber told us. That the effect of Cole's paper was to delay the hunt for asteroids for as much as a decade. I started wondering if that was the point. So you think someone wants us all to be k*lled by a giant rock? My theory is much more out there, so to speak. I'm all ears. What if what was bad for asteroid hunting was good for asteroid mining? Excuse me? There's gold in them there rocks, Watson. Platinum, too. Lots of it. Just as Julius said"", "". Platinum, too. Lots of it. Just as Julius said. Yeah, but nobody's gonna be able to fly a ship to an asteroid until sometime in the 2020s. A crucial element to my theory. Come on. “Michael Hines, CEO Aurum Aeronautics. Barbara Torrissi, CEO Exterral Dynamics.” I thought everyone was hurt equally by Cole's paper. I no longer think that's true. Combined, those four companies are investing billions towards the long-term prospects for asteroid mining""]"

Someone recently paid your mortgage in full. It was paid by a third party. We're already trying to link that to your boss. What does that have to do with Joaquin? Bell: Werner Platz wanted Mr. Pereya to alter his... shmeat so the FDA would classify it as a meat substitute. Then he could sell it to the kosher and halal markets. Watson: But Pereya was a true believer. He cared more about disrupting the meat industry than he did about the profits"", ""... neutral? Exactly, it's the Switzerland of food. Now, if shmeat is ruled to be actual meat, that obviously opens up the carnivore market, but it also subjects it to the Gordian Knot of halal and kosher certification. If it is a mere meat substitute, then it sits, forlorn, in the vegan aisle. But if shmeat can thread the needle, if it can be actual lab-grown meat, but not be classified as such... It would be pareve, neutral to the kosher and halal rules about meat. Imagine, Watson"", '. We had a plan. We were ready to go through with it. But MCR canceled the contract before we did the job. Why would they do that? An FDA ruling came down, about the food Pereya was developing. The government classified it as ""meat substitute,"" instead of recognizing it as meat. So, Next Century Meat\'s product will be relegated to the tofu aisle, along with veggie burgers, and other fringe foodstuffs.
