♪
You wanted to see me?
Shut the door, would you?
Have a seat.
(sighs)
My sister is a big reader.
She's always got a book in her hands.
Most of it's crap-- the kind of books, you know, you buy at the airport and leave on the plane.
Anyway... for the last couple of months, she has been hounding me to read this.
The Heart Bled Blue.
You ever heard of it?
No.
Does the author's name ring a bell?
No. Why?
Because it's about two detectives.
One is a beautiful Chinese-American woman.
The other, her partner, is a guy from London.
You're kidding.
They live together.
They consult for the NYPD.
Their names aren't Holmes and Watson, but still.
You may not know Grover Ogden, but he seems to know a lot about you.
(chain saws buzzing)
(saw revving, buzzing)
I'm not paying your guys to sit around, Vince.
What's the holdup?
Couldn't get the chipper going when we got here.
I think it's jammed.
It was fine yesterday.
Vince: Repair guy's on his way.
How long are we talking?
Um, hour.
Maybe two?
I got ten more plots to clear before I can stop pouring foundations.
Where's the jam?
Probably somewhere between the drum and the cutter knives.
(grunts)
I got it!
Start it up.
(engine starting)
Whoa! Shut it down!
Right now!
What now?
Look.
♪ Elementary 4x07 ♪
Miss Taken
Original Air Date on January 7, 2016
Gregson: Believe it or not, this used to be an FBI agent.
Or, at least, that's what the badge says.
Lab is running the DNA to make sure.
Special Agent Robert Underhill, retired.
His car was found about 200 yards from the scene.
Gregson: I reached out to the Bureau's New York office; they're standing by to help, but... since Underhill was officially a civilian, it's our case.
No Joan today?
She's going to join us later.
So what else do we know about Special Agent Underhill?
An exemplary 34-year career, well-liked by his colleagues.
He and his wife Sheila moved to Kauai, 2012.
They moved back to New York about seven months ago.
Well, assuming this is Special Agent Underhill, he would've been dead before he went into the wood chipper.
The k*ller would've had to dismember him in order to get him through the infeed chute.
Right, so CSU examined all the chain saws that were used at the site, and found one with some blood between the teeth.
(sniffing)
They think someone used it and then cleaned it last night.
Oleoresin capsicum.
More commonly known as... (sniffs) pepper spray.
We should alert the M.E. that this bag contains at least part of the face.
I'm sure he'll appreciate that.
So the bootprint found next to his car suggests he drove there himself.
Pepper spray, it's a close-range w*apon.
Whoever deployed it would have had to have been close to him.
You think he was invited to the scene, knew his attacker.
The agent was a large man-- at least 220 pounds.
So if I was going to turn him into pulp, I'd want him as close to that wood chipper as possible.
You said his wife's name was Sheila?
Mm.
We should talk to her, see if she knows her way around a chain saw.
What makes you think she did this?
Well, his personal effects are here. I see the remains of a wallet, watch... there's no wedding ring.
And this bag, amongst the skin and bones, has flecks of latex and foil.
Looks like he was carrying at least one wrapped condom with him.
So he may not have been ready for a fight, but... he was ready for fun.
Bob wasn't cheating on me.
At least, not with another woman.
The only affair he ever had was with his job.
It was our understanding your husband retired in 2012.
He did. We sold our house and moved to Kauai.
Then he got restless.
Missed his work, missed the city.
I could tell he wasn't happy, so I agreed to move back.
Holmes: Respectfully, Mrs. Underhill, we found evidence that he may have still been restless: the remains of two unused prophylactics.
We separated six months ago.
It was amicable.
We stayed in touch.
So you separated but didn't divorce.
I'm guessing that means you're still his primary beneficiary.
You'd have been entitled to his pension, his life insurance...
I had dinner at my daughter's house in New Jersey last night.
Drank half a bottle of rosé, spent the night in the guest room.
Can anyone other than your daughter confirm that?
I took a train back to the city this morning.
There should be a record of my ticket purchase and... security footage from stations.
All right, we'll look into it.
In the meantime, can you think of anyone who would've wanted to hurt your husband?
After we moved back to New York, Bob started looking into some of his old cases.
Ones that he never solved.
He asked a friend at the Bureau for copies of a bunch of files.
The last time we spoke, he said he thought one of those cases was finally going to crack. He was closing in on someone.
Who?
I don't know.
Out of respect, he kept shop talk to a minimum after we separated.
But I'm sure if you go to his apartment, you'll find all the files.
They may tell you everything you need to know.
(knocking on door)
Joanie.
My gosh.
It's been months.
You look beautiful.
Thanks, Dad.
Or should I call you Grover Ogden?
What were you thinking?
I was honoring you.
The choices you make, the work you do.
I think it's wonderful.
Really?
So that's why you didn't ask my permission.
That's why you used a pseudonym.
Because you knew how honored I would be.
Did you even read the book?
Of course I read the book.
And?
It's ridiculous.
Sherlock and I do not run around with g*ns and we don't get into kung fu fights with criminals and we sure as hell do not sleep together.
Well, sex sells, Joanie.
You know that.
So how did you know that that was me?
Grover Ogden?
We lived on Ogden Avenue.
Grover was our dog.
And by the way, that is how you make a porn name, not a pen name!
Okay, look, I owed my publishers a book.
I was blocked. I've never been blocked like this before.
I was going crazy.
So your mother comes home from seeing you in the city, and she tells me about this case you're working on, so...
Did she know about this?
No. I'm just telling you how it all happened.
I don't care how it happened.
I just want it to go away.
Well, what does that mean?
The Heart Bled Blue didn't get the e-book treatment, which is good, for both of us, because I spent almost $4,000 last night trying to find all the hard copies I could find online.
You're gonna contact your publisher and you're gonna track down the rest.
(chuckling): You can't be serious.
Did Sherlock read the book?
What does that have to do with anything?
Well, you gave your opinion.
I'd like to know his.
Okay, first, you are not friends.
You met him once, at Aunt Vivian's funeral.
Second, he is never gonna find out about this.
He is the most private person that I know. He would freak if he found out.
Call your publisher, Dad.
I mean it.
Holmes: Typically, I'm averse to color coordination, but I dare say it brightens the place up.
What is all this?
The case files of the late Bob Underhill.
You got my texts?
m*rder*d FBI agent fed through a wood chipper.
His wife thought it was over one of his unsolved cases.
Marcus and I went to his apartment and discovered he had been revisiting three of them.
I made copies of his files and assigned each case its own room.
As you can see, the library tells the tale of a hate crime, a church burnt to the ground in 1981.
The arsonist, never identified.
You think that's who k*lled Underhill?
I do not.
Thanks in no small part to the late agent's meticulous notes, I identified the guilty party.
He died in 1982.
This case took longer to solve, but not much.
Two-man bank robbery from 1997.
As it turns out, both parties went to jail for unrelated crimes in the early aughts.
Both parties remain incarcerated, so they're not our K*llers either.
Finally, the case of a serial poisoner who took six lives between 2008 and 2012.
I realized that the culprit was, in fact, the brother of one of Underhill's original suspects.
The only problem, he's in the Navy and he was on an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea last night.
So you took the three cases this guy couldn't crack over an entire career and you solved them in a few hours.
Bad news is his wife was wrong.
Underhill's old cases had nothing to do with his m*rder.
Actually, I think one of them did.
I asked the captain to find out if Underhill had requested any other case files, and it turns out he had.
Mina Davenport.
Oh, you're familiar with the case?
Of course.
She was kidnapped in 2004.
The guy who took her kept her in a basement.
Ten years later, she escaped and came home-- it was a huge story.
Are you saying that Underhill worked her abduction in '04?
He did. And again in 2015.
He asked for and received copies of her case file just a few months ago.
Curious, then, that they were not amongst his many other materials.
Well, Mina's kidnapper was never found.
You think that's who Underhill was closing in on?
I think the absence of the files the agent requested is very suspicious.
Perhaps the k*ller removed them from his person last night.
Perhaps, post-mulching, he used his keys to access his apartment.
Either way, it could mean that Mina's abductor committed a m*rder less than 20 miles from her home last night.
Woman: It's hard to explain, losing your only child when she's ten, and then getting her back at 20.
People tend to think about the ten years you lost, but we could only think about the future; all the time we were gonna have together after all.
It was a gift.
But we knew there was a catch, that the monster who had taken Mina was still out there.
Bell: Like I said, we can't be sure he's the one who k*lled Bob Underhill.
We wanted to know if you've seen anything out of the ordinary lately, any strange faces or vehicles?
No.
Nothing.
What about Mina?
If she had, she would've told us.
Is she here?
She's upstairs with her tutor.
She's working on her GED.
I mean, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not bring her into this.
If we're right, Mr. Davenport, she may be at the very center of it.
Richard: Well, if you're right.
If you're not, you could just upset her.
You could set her back months.
We've worked so hard to make her feel safe; to help her find some peace.
After she first got away, she wouldn't let anyone touch her, not for weeks.
Now she'll let me hold her hand again.
She'll... let me hug her.
What about Bob Underhill?
Had you heard from him lately?
(sighs)
I wish we had.
Uh...
Look, a... a-after this happened, I-I, um...
I-I could hardly function.
I was the one who was supposed to pick Mina up from school that day; I-I was the one who let the meeting run long, I...
I mean, it was my fault that she tried to walk home and, um...
(sighs)
...when I could do nothing, Agent Underhill did everything.
He was, uh... he was our rock.
Holmes: We knew that Mina was able to help the FBI generate a sketch of her captor.
She even, uh, provided a first name: Keith.
In the months since her return, has she remembered any other salient details?
Anything that might help us identify him?
I'm sorry. No.
Mina: Mom... Dad...
Is everything okay?
It's all right, sweetie.
We'll be done in here in just a minute.
Bell: Davenports may not have seen Keith around, but that doesn't mean we can't circulate his sketch.
Watson: Even if he didn't k*ll Underhill, he's still worth finding.
Assuming a figment of someone's imagination can be found.
What is that supposed to mean?
That man did not k*ll Agent Underhill, nor did he kidnap that young woman.
The description she gave is entirely fictional.
Hold up-- are you calling Mina Davenport a liar?
No, I'm calling that young girl a liar.
She's not Mina Davenport.
She's an imposter.
Holmes: The old proverb says the eyes are the window to the soul.
In this case, it's the ears.
Note, in each image, the depth of the triangular fossa and the degree of attachment of the lobule.
These are the ears of two different people.
They don't look that different to me.
Watson?
He's right.
The architecture of the second ear is all wrong.
Mina Davenport disappeared when she was ten years old.
She grew; she changed. Her body changed.
But not her ears.
They grow as kids get older, but they don't change shape.
Basically, this girl could not have grown up to become this girl.
We no longer think that Agent Underhill was onto Mina Davenport's abductor.
We believe he was onto her imposter.
Because of ears.
Six months ago, the first pictures of Miracle Mina were released by her family to the press.
Two weeks later, Agent Underhill requested copies of any and all files pertaining to her disappearance in 2004.
Now, perhaps he noticed the same discrepancy I did.
Perhaps it was something else.
Either way, I believe that he suspected this girl had taken the place of the real Mina.
Presumably to avail herself of the Davenports' vast wealth.
The girl you're saying isn't Mina, she passed a DNA test.
Tell me that wasn't in Underhill's files?
It was.
Her DNA was a perfect match for the sample taken from Mina's toothbrush in 2004.
Funny thing about that toothbrush.
It disappeared around the same time as the test.
The private lab which compared the two samples chalked it up to human error.
We think the imposter had an accomplice, someone inside the lab who made sure to test her DNA against itself and then got rid of the toothbrush to prevent future tests.
Frankly, Captain, I'm surprised you don't find our thesis more compelling.
I find it compelling as hell, but I also think I'm the only parent in the room.
You know your kids.
I don't care if they're gone ten years or 50.
You know them.
How many of your children have been kidnapped?
I'm merely pointing out that these parents could hardly be blamed for falling prey to a charlatan.
They dreamt of their daughter's safe return for over a decade.
We want to invite them in, break the news to them as gently as possible.
All they have to do is let us take a DNA sample from them, and then we can compare that to the samples taken from the imposter in 2014.
Those, the lab does still have.
They'll prove that she isn't who she says she is.
At the very least, Captain, the Davenports deserve to know whether they have a k*ller living under their roof.
Mr. Davenport... thanks for coming.
Yeah.
Of course.
You said you had news.
We do, but... we thought your wife was joining.
Yeah.
She's just right there.
Oh, you brought Mina.
Yeah, well, after you left last night, she just kept asking questions about you and... she knows something's up, so Nancy and I... well, we told her the truth.
She was... very brave.
She, uh, said she wanted to know everything.
Mina... this is Detective Bell.
This is Ms. Watson and Mr. Holmes.
Actually, Mina, we were hoping to talk to your parents alone.
Oh.
Whatever you have to say, I can hear it.
I never met Agent Underhill, but I know how much he did for my mom and dad.
I want to help.
Mina: It was my birthday that week.
Not my real birthday; the one he'd given me.
Keith.
It was the one time of year he was actually nice to me.
It wasn't until later that I realized it was the anniversary of the day he took me.
We had just gotten back from a trip.
So this Keith-- he was, uh, he was a trucker and, uh, he kept you stashed in the back of his, uh, cab during long hauls.
I wasn't allowed to leave the truck, but...
I could look out the window sometimes.
I could see trees, cars... other people.
When I was in the basement, it was... it was just me.
So, um, according to this file, uh, you-you never had any inkling, uh, what city or state Keith's home was in.
Well, I was so young when he took me and I wasn't...
I wasn't allowed to watch any TV or look at a newspaper, ever.
The FBI people said that was because he needed me to be completely dependent on him.
It worked.
So you were saying it was the-the week of your birthday...
Keith said it was time.
We started thinking about having a family.
And I, and I couldn't stop thinking about that.
We were on the road.
Another trip.
I... waited until he fell asleep, and then...
I went into his bag.
And I took out the straight razor he used to shave and I held it right up to his neck.
But you didn't do it.
I don't know why, I just couldn't.
I got out of the truck and I just ran and I didn't stop running until that morning.
Holmes: And you were in, uh, Lander, Pennsylvania.
I didn't know it at the time, but yes.
So then you, um, you shut yourself into a gas station restroom and you take out Keith's straight razor and you cut off all your hair.
Keith forced me to dye my hair blonde.
He had, ever since I was ten.
My therapist said I was reclaiming my old self, but... (indistinct talking) to be honest... I don't even remember doing it.
I couldn't even tell you what I was thinking.
Well, what you were thinking is that you wanted to look as pathetic as possible when-when the police found you.
Yeah.
I...
You are one of the best liars I have ever met, and that's saying something.
It's small wonder you've managed to fool the Davenports.
Richard: No, look, I'm sorry.
What?
I mean, they're still defending you right now.
Gregson: Mr. Davenport...
They still believe you're their daughter, (Richard speaking angrily) ...but we, of course, we know you are not.
Mina, we're leaving.
Dad-Daddy, what's going on?
Come on. Right now.
It's okay, sweetie, you haven't done anything wrong.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Stay the hell away from my family!
Smells like something died in here.
I'd hardly expect elephant dung to smell like potpourri.
It is, in fact, a highly sought-after coffee, produced by feeding arabica beans to pachyderms in northern Thailand.
And it has the potential to further reduce my need for sleep.
Would you...?
No, thanks.
I had poop for lunch.
You should've seen the Davenports' faces when we broke the news to them.
I mean, I knew they'd take it hard, but I didn't think they'd refuse to give us their DNA.
We underestimated the hold the imposter has over them.
If they won't help prove she's a fraud, we'll just see if she k*lled Bob Underhill instead.
Yesterday you said you had to accompany your mother to a doctor's appointment in Scarsdale.
That's right.
Only you didn't.
You didn't even see her.
You saw your stepfather instead.
May I assume your visit had something to do with his book?
You know about the book?
An hour ago, I signed for a box which contained nearly 200 copies... but I've been aware of it for months.
An associate brought it to my attention.
You read it?
I did.
You're not mad?
Should I be?
Of course you should, you're you.
It's hardly the first time I've inspired a writer, Watson.
I am actually the basis for several fictional characters across various media.
It's one of the by-products of my success as a detective.
I fascinate; this cannot be helped.
You yourself once wrote about me:
The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes.
When did you...?
I was displeased because you used my real name and you shared my real history.
Your father's magnum opus, on the other hand, is the very opposite of real.
Look no further than chapter 32, where we make love beneath a footbridge in Central Park.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
The book, not chapter 32.
Your stepfather uses pseudonym, and I assumed you were the reason for that.
(sighs)
You seem angrier than I'd expected.
May I ask why?
(doorbell buzzes)
Are you expecting someone?
I got your address off the card you left with my parents.
You mean, your marks.
They think I'm at my tutor's right now.
Can I come in?
I'm not sure you should.
There's no wood chipper in here.
Uh... you can frisk me.
Whatever you want.
I... I just want to talk.
You're right about a lot of things.
But you're wrong about others.
You admit you're not Mina Davenport.
I do.
But I didn't k*ll that FBI guy.
And why should we believe you?
Because...
...I can tell you who did.
Richard and Nancy.
The Davenports?
And why, pray tell, would they m*rder the man who worked so hard to find their daughter?
Because... he was about to figure out their secret.
No one took Mina.
They k*lled her.
My real name is Cassie, but you can call me Mina, if it's easier.
I'm used to it.
You have a second name?
For the purpose of this conversation, no.
There's a reason I came to talk to you and not the police.
Do tell.
Mina turns 21 in a couple of weeks.
Or, at least she would have.
When that happens, I get access to her trust.
There's almost five million in it.
If you keep my secret until then, I'll tell you everything.
I'll even be your eyes and ears inside the house.
You... you think I'm lying again.
Why would we not?
A couple of years ago, I came across this magazine article.
It was the anniversary of Mina's disappearance, and they did this computer thing to show what she would look like if she were still alive.
I realized I looked like her.
Not a lot, but enough.
I thought if I studied the case, if I learned everything I could about her, I could fool people.
Because you'd run cons before?
Nothing like this.
This was big.
I had to trick Mina's own parents.
So you came up with a story that would allow for the occasional trip-up.
You were abused, locked in a basement, you forgot your old life; that way, no one would be suspicious when you had trouble remembering things the real Mina would have known.
My favorite wrinkle was Keith's truck.
You said you'd escaped from it, as opposed to the house, because, like Keith, the house didn't exist, and you didn't have to worry about leading anyone back to it.
I was never worried about fooling the police or the FBI.
Just Richard and Nancy.
I had this whole script ready, things I would say or do, if I thought they were getting suspicious.
Only... I never needed it.
They treated me like their daughter from the second I met them.
At first I thought I was just that good.
But a couple months ago, something happened.
I, um...
I woke up in the middle of the night and...
Richard was sitting there.
He touched my arm.
He said this was something he and Mina used to do.
He said, "You are my little girl, aren't you?"
You get it, right?
He knew I wasn't her because he'd k*lled her.
He was abusing her.
She must have threatened to tell someone and...
You said Nancy was involved, too.
No one worked harder to teach me about Mina's old life.
She needed to make sure no one else knew I wasn't really her daughter.
Because that would guarantee no one would uncover Richard's crime.
He lied to you the other night.
The FBI guy had come to the house.
I saw them arguing in the driveway that night.
I didn't know who he was, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but then, when you guys came to the house, I...
He figured me out.
He must have.
So Richard k*lled him.
Two weeks-- that's all I need.
You keep all of this between us... and I'll help you get justice for Mina.
Deal.
These are listening devices.
Bugs.
I need you to plant one on the first floor of the Davenports' home and one on the second.
This one's sort of big.
It's imperative you put both of them near windows.
This will make it easier for us to pick up and record their conversations.
Have I made myself clear?
Yeah.
So why are you still here?
I know I did something terrible.
But Richard and Nancy did something worse.
You won't regret this, I promise.
(sighs)
You're almost as good of a liar as she is.
She actually thinks you believe her.
She's obviously attempting to divert attention until she can claim Mina's trust money and disappear.
Then why did you just give her two bugs?
You know she's not gonna say anything incriminating when she's around them.
Actually, Watson, only one of them is a bug.
The other is a flash bang.
You gave her a b*mb?
It's a very small b*mb with a very big bang.
Tomorrow morning, I will activate the listening device, and when I'm certain all three family members are on one floor, I'll detonate the flash bang on the other.
If they don't call the police themselves, one of their neighbors will.
And then we can poke around their house without a warrant and collect all the DNA we want.
The Davenports aren't gonna trust any test results from us, not after today.
As I said earlier, I'm only interested in whether our imposter k*lled Bob Underhill.
His m*rder was especially violent.
She would have been covered in his blood.
If she carried any trace of it back to the house, we'll have her, no matter who the Davenports think she is.
(siren whooping, indistinct radio communication)
(indistinct chatter)
I thought you said it was a small b*mb.
No, no! No, you people are not coming into my home!
Mr. Davenport, we are here to help you, believe it or not.
Oh, like hell you are.
Gregson: Mr. Davenport, I understand you're not happy to see any of us, but when a b*mb goes off on your property, you don't get to pick and choose who investigates.
May we assume the expl*sive device was not yours, Mr. Davenport?
Of course it wasn't.
Well, then, you have our word we will not rest until the guilty party has been identified.
So, uh...
(low, indistinct talking)
Hey, I checked the security system.
It was enabled, but it wasn't tripped.
No signs that anyone broke in to plant the device.
Got to be the girl, right?
What are the chances of this happening one day after we accuse her of running a con?
Yeah, but the upside? She gets to play the victim card again?
Watson: Whatever her reasons were, we should be glad.
We have all morning to look for proof she k*lled Underhill.
Bell: That was a bust, too.
Her bedroom and bathroom were spotless.
Nothing in the drains, the carpet or the hamper.
Kitchen and, uh, laundry room were equally clean, but let's not forget the obscenity of the Davenports' wealth.
By my count, we still have ten rooms to go.
All right, let's check out CSU, and see how they're doing.
It's because he cheated on my mother.
My stepfather.
You asked me yesterday why I was so angry about the book.
Yes, I remember, and I recall the affair, but what one has to do with the other...?
He was always a free spirit, adventurous, did what he wanted when he wanted.
I loved that about him.
Until what he wanted was something other than Mary.
It wasn't even serious.
Just some woman he met at a book signing, back when he was still putting his name on his own work.
And then my mother found out.
Well, she's a proud woman.
I'm sure it was difficult.
Well, things weren't the same after that.
She and my father patched things up, but I don't know.
I guess I kept him at arm's length.
And then, when he wrote that book, it was like he was thinking about himself again.
Speaking of people who think they can get away with things, look at the seat.
Note how close it is to the pedals.
This has been adjusted for somebody short, not Richard Davenport, who by my estimation is six foot tall.
Nancy, meanwhile, drives this SUV.
I know 'cause I saw her keys at the station yesterday.
So you think this is the car the imposter drives.
Look at the brake pedal.
Watson: Blood.
Agent Underhill's, I presume, transferred from the bottom of his k*ller's shoe.
(doorbell buzzes)
(door opening)
Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, I have something for you, and I thought I'd drop it off in person.
Come in.
Wow. Really love what you've done with this place.
I'll tell Sherlock.
I'm sure he can do the same for you and Mom.
Is he around?
No, he's at the precinct.
Uh, we're waiting to hear about some blood that we found.
Oh, that sounds exciting.
So did you talk to your publisher?
(sighing) Hey, the wheels are in motion.
I don't know the ins and the outs, but suffice it to say that The Heart Bled Blue is about to become very difficult to find.
I appreciate that.
Mm-hmm.
What's this?
Uh, that's the sequel.
You wrote another book based on me and Sherlock?
Wait-- before you take my head off, I already told the editor that he can't have it; it's all yours.
I was just putting the finishing touches on it when you came by the house the other day.
I don't understand. Is this for me to burn?
That's for you to do with whatever you like.
I missed you, Joanie, and that's the real reason I wrote about you.
I mean, these last few years, ever since I... strayed...
You know, I know that I screwed up.
I knew it the moment that it happened.
But what I didn't know, what I wasn't ready for, was what it would do to us.
You used to be my friend.
And I ruined that.
The book is just my way of dealing with it.
It let me be close to you again.
(phone ringing)
Hmm. No rest for the weary.
Dad, just... just hold on, okay?
(ringing continues)
Hello?
Holmes: The blood on the brake pedal came from Bob Underhill.
I didn't think we'd hear back from the lab this quickly.
We didn't hear back from the lab.
We heard from Richard Davenport.
He's here, and he claims he k*lled Underhill, and he wants to confess.
Holmes: Oh, she's told him a sob story. She must have.
Something along the lines of, "The mean FBI man confronted me, accused me of all the things the police did. I was frightened, I snapped."
He's still utterly convinced she's his daughter.
She knew he blamed himself for what happened to the real Mina.
In 2004, he couldn't save her.
In 2015, he can.
Well, however she did it, she's forcing our hand.
We either got to charge him or find some way of proving that he's covering for her.
Holmes: I think the choice is clear.
Mina, or whatever her name is, in a rush to escape a m*rder charge, has made a mistake.
Accept the false confession and book Richard Davenport.
That will make it easier to obtain a sample of his DNA.
Watson: We can compare it to the samples that were taken from the imposter when she turned up last year.
We can show him the results.
There you go.
I'm not sure that would have been enough to convince him, but now, staring down the barrel of life in prison, we might be able to get him to see the light.
Watson: The DNA was a match?
This can't be right.
All I can tell you is what the lab told me.
The girl's DNA is a familial match to Richard Davenport.
According to the report, she's his daughter.
It's the same results as the original report that matched her to Mina's toothbrush.
Now, I know you thought she had an accomplice, someone on the inside.
This test was done in-house.
We put a rush on it.
There is no way she could have effected the results.
Holmes: Then someone made a mistake.
The girl that we're dealing with is not Mina Davenport.
Her genetic material says otherwise.
What about her ears?
It doesn't trump a DNA test.
It says there that Richard Davenport's DNA was compared to a sample of the imposter's hair.
That's right.
Wouldn't it have been standard procedure to take a cheek swab when she was oh-so-miraculously found 14 months ago?
It would, but the FBI said she was in such a feral state, she wouldn't let anyone near her.
So they bagged the hair that she had cut off in the gas station bathroom.
Bell: Maybe she's not Mina, but she is Davenport's daughter.
Well, say he had an affair.
The girl was born out of wedlock.
She pretended to be Mina to mess with him, get everything she thought she deserved.
Well, that would actually explain a lot.
No.
Respectfully, Detective, I don't like that theory.
That's a bad theory.
Gregson: Why is it a bad theory?
'Cause it wouldn't account for Mina, the real Mina, and what happened to her in 2004.
Bell: It's not supposed to.
It's supposed to explain how a girl we think is a fraud passed a DNA test.
I've got a different theory-- better one.
I mean, I-I prefer it.
Trust me when I say that you will, too.
Mrs. Davenport, thank you so much for coming.
This is my attorney, Mr. O'Donnell.
Holmes: Earlier today, the woman that you know as your daughter...
She is my daughter.
She passed a DNA test, or at least a strand of her hair did.
It was a familial match for a cheek swab taken from your husband.
Watson: The thing is, that hair did not come directly from Mina's head.
It was one of the hairs that she claimed she cut off with a straight razor the day she was found.
Claimed?
This was the second test she passed. We were suspicious of the test she took 14 months ago, because Mina's toothbrush, the source of the comparison sample-- disappeared.
But then, this morning, when the results of the second test arrived, we wondered what if the loss of the toothbrush really was human error?
What if she had passed both tests because the hair that was examined really did come from Mina?
You're not making any sense.
Please.
Holmes: It occurred to me that if someone had access to Mina's hair 14 months ago, then they also had access to Mina...
Watson: It was hard to imagine a woman allowing someone to take a straight razor to her head willingly.
So we reached out to law enforcement across the country.
We found a report of an as*ault in Sturbridge, Massachusetts, where a young woman wearing a mask att*cked another young woman and shaved her head.
Holmes: Not the kind of crime you see every day.
Even more remarkable-- the as*ault was perpetrated just two days... before the imposter was found in Lander, Pennsylvania.
She'd located Mina, you see.
And instead of reporting it to the authorities, she took her hair.
She then scattered that around in Pennsylvania as if it was her own.
The victim of the Sturbridge attack gave a fake name at the hospital.
She was signed out by a man named Norman Ott.
Mr. Ott, it turns out, lived near Mina's school in 2004.
His apartment was on a route she would've taken home.
It's really her, Nancy.
It's really Mina.
It... No.
I... It can't...
Holmes: When the police paid a visit to Mr. Ott's home in Sturbridge today; he wasn't home, but Mina was.
Watson: Over the years, he told different stories about her.
Some people thought she was his daughter.
Others thought she was his wife.
The only thing we know for sure is that she was allowed to leave the house sometimes.
That's how the imposter was able to gain access to her.
Holmes: You can imagine she's been through quite an ordeal, but she remembers you and Richard, and she's been asking for you.
So as soon as he's recanted his confession, he'll be brought here.
Would you like me to take you to see her?
(quiet sob)
Hi. Joanie, what are you...?
I'm sorry I got so angry about the book.
Oh, you don't have anything to apologize for. Come in.
Well, I've changed my mind.
I'm okay with it being out there, so whatever you told your publishers to do, you can tell them to stop.
It's all right.
You're sure?
I read the sequel.
I actually think it's better than the first.
Yeah. A-And you... you made some notes.
Just a few.
I thought we could spend some time and talk about them.
Well... it would be an honor.

Holmes: Cassie?

Mind if I call you Cassie?
I'd call you by your real name, but you're refusing to give it.
Cassie is fine.
Sorry I missed your arrest and booking, but I've been coordinating the effort to identify you.
To my great surprise, your fingerprints weren't in AFIS.
Of course they aren't.
I've never committed any crimes.
You've never been caught.
Is there a difference?
So how old are you? Really?
Fifteen.
No, wait.
Twenty-five.
Or maybe it's some other number.
My colleagues showed your photograph to Mina Davenport.
She says she's never seen you before.
You're also a stranger to Norman Ott.
He was taken into custody yesterday.
Who?
He wasn't lying when he said he never met you before.
I could tell.
Would you at least concede you spent some time in Sturbridge?
How else would you know about Mina's situation?
I've been to lots of places.
Have you enjoyed them?
'Cause your time of coming and going is now squarely in the past.
You think I k*lled that FBI agent, but... you don't have a m*rder w*apon, just some blood in a car.
I've already come up with six different ways to explain it.
Tell me one.
(sighs): Um...
I hope you come to my trial.
Should be fun.
Think you can lie your way out?
I do.
Now tell me... am I lying?
