Welcome to our New Fully Upgraded Site! Our site was designed to be an interactive community where members could have all the latest features they wanted, and Editors could have a site work for them as they needed.
***Please note, our site recognizes the word "the" as silent. Therefore, all shows & movies that start with the word such as: The Lion King would be categorized under L for Lion King, The or The Walking Dead would be under W for Walking Dead, The.

Thank you to everyone for taking the time to email general board corrections/ episode mix-ups, mistakes and missing episodes... I try my best to reply back to all emails within 24-48 hours, check your spam folder also! Contact Us Here Or you can use the Contact Us form at the top of the board to request any TV show or movie you'd like to see added!
Anyone can help edit any of our transcripts at any time with adding character names, locations or just fix spacing and/or sentence structure start by:
Copy/Paste and use Notepad++/Word or whatever program you want... watch the episode/movie and add names/numbers to it, correct/join sentences. Email us the updated copy to replace on the board. Full credit will be given to you. If you love it, you can register & volunteer to be a board Editor; if you hate it at least you made one episode/movie better for the world to read. :)
Examples of ones that have previously been done:
Game of Thrones: viewtopic.php?t=7743
Twilight: viewtopic.php?t=9144
****Lastly, if our site is ever down or experiencing problems you can read current status updates on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/foreverdreaming.org/ Please, try not to overwhelm us by sending emails as that takes away time from us trying to fix any major issues. Thank you for your support and understanding!
